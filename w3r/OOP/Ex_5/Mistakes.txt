Book.java
Lack of Information in toString(): Your toString() method returns only the title. Imagine a book where the cover only had the title and nothing else â€“ no author, no synopsis. That's your toString() method.


Collection.java
Terrible Naming Conventions: Collection as a class name? That's like naming your pet dog "Dog". It's way too generic. And what's with the fantasyCollection, scifiCollection as ArrayList<Object>? It's like using a shoebox to store everything from shoes to sandwiches.
Type Safety Ignored: ArrayList<Object> for storing books? It's like putting socks and sandwiches in the same drawer. You should be using ArrayList<Book> for type safety.
Redundant Collections: Having a separate collection for each genre is like having a different wallet for each type of bill. It's unnecessarily complicated. Ever heard of a Map<String, List<Book>>?


Main.java
Testing... Or Lack Thereof: This isn't so much testing as throwing code at the wall and seeing what sticks. There's no structure or meaningful validation of results.
Unclear Method Calls: The way you're adding books to collections is as clear as mud. collection.getCollection("fantasyCollection")? It's like asking for directions and being told to turn north at the blue house.


General Observations
Encapsulation is a Myth Here: Your fields should be private with public getters and setters. Right now, it's like having a house with no doors - everything's just out there.
Exception Handling is Non-Existent: Your code assumes everything will go as planned. That's like expecting to never hit a red light on your way to work.
Documentation is a Foreign Concept: There are no comments or explanations. It's like you're writing a mystery novel, not a piece of code.
