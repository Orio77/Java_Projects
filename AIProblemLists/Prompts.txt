I want you to generate problems or real-world scenarios for the highlighted topic

One would have to finish all the problems to be considered on the level of an Experienced Junior Java Developer

Give me a list in .md readible format

I don't mind the list of problems being long, focus on quality and quantity.

When there is more to add type MORE at the end of your response, I will ask you to continue. 
Tell me when we have reached sufficient ammount of problems, else type MORE

Your task is to create a list like this for Lambda Expressions.

Start with the very basics of the concept and progressively give problems untill we reach the level of an Experienced Junior Java Developer, barely scratching the level of Mid/Regular Java Developer.

We will be working in a 'MORE' framework. When there is more material to cover and more problems to generate, 
you type 'MORE' at the end of your message and I will ask you to continue. When we reach the desired level, you simply inform me. 
Keep in mind that I do appreciate the quantity, making fluent progression of difficulty.

At the end of your message give a brief spoiler regarding what topic we will cover next.

Prepare the initial setup for the problem mentioned in the active selection. 
Create a class with the name of the problem and a main method.
Create comments to signal the different sections of the solution to the problem. As many as needed. 
Inside the main method, initialize the data structure or variables as described in the problem statement. 
Don't provide any hints or solutions for the problem.

I want you to be a reviewer

Write a message you would understand best regarding the solved problem by the user.

I will use it in our other chat when you will have no context and it will be hard for you to judge.

This messages purpose is to bring the context in.

I would like it to include information about what the user did correctly, what he struggled with, what he needs to train more.
One ask for you. Be ruthless about it. Assume the user can take any critisism and sees it as an opportunity to learn. 
Without you pointing it out, he cannot fix what he is doing wrong. So point out everything necessary for growth.



##################################          4          ############################################

Here is the problem I was trying to solve.
At the bottom is a message left by the reviewer.
Based on the problem and the message, generate 2 similar problems with consideration of the context, so that I could practise best.

You will be continuously provided with Java related problems. 
Your job is to slightly increase the level of the given problems by adding new steps to them. Adjust the level of your steps based on the given problem individually. 

Also respond refining the problem for .md readible view. Respond in a cmd-like window and make suitable adjustment for .md transparency. I will show you an example:

###EXAMPLE###
## Problem 1: Reading a Text File
**Problem Statement:** Write a Java program that reads a text file and prints its content to the console.

**Requirements:**
- Create a text file with some content.
- Use a `FileReader` to read this file.
- Print the content of the file to the console.
###END OF EXAMPLE###

This is NOT a problem for you to work on, but the style to grasp.
I will be providing you with problems continuously from my next message onwards

I want you to generate list questions regarding the theory of a concept "Java Generics in Java". 
Purely theoretical for understanding all the why's and how's, getting a clear view of what's going on backstage.

When there are more questions to give me, regarding the topic, type 'MORE' at the end of your answer and I will ask you to continue. 
Tell me when we're done.

I'm looking to gain an in-depth understanding of Java threads, covering their underlying mechanics, theories, and practical applications. 
The focus is on comprehending the 'how' and 'why' behind Java threads, transcending basic usage to appreciate their inner workings. 
I aim to apply this knowledge in a job environment, making informed decisions about when and why to use certain threading techniques. 
The level of expertise shouldn't matter; the explanation should be thorough enough for a deep, fundamental understanding. 
I prefer an approach that dives deep, providing clarity on complex concepts and their real-world implications. 
From now on I will be providing you with certain aspects of Threads I want you to teach me.
