## Problem 1: Implementing Custom Sorting with Comparable

**Task:** Create a `Person` class with `age` and `name` attributes. 
Implement the `Comparable` interface to sort `Person` objects first by `age`, then by `name`. 
Test your implementation by creating a list of `Person` objects, sorting them, and then printing the sorted list.
**Objective:** This will help you understand how to implement and use the `Comparable` interface correctly.




## Problem 2: Advanced Sorting with Comparator

**Task:** Modify the `Person` class from Problem 1 to not implement `Comparable`. 
Instead, write separate `Comparator` implementations: one for sorting by `age` and another for sorting by `name`. 
Test both comparators by sorting a list of `Person` objects first by one attribute, then the other.
**Objective:** This exercise aims to deepen your understanding of the `Comparator` interface and how it differs from `Comparable`.
