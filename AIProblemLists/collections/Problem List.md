```diff
- Challenge 1: Advanced ListIterator Usage
- Task: Create a list of random integers between 1 and 100. Using a ListIterator, perform the following tasks:

- Add a number after every element that is a multiple of 10.
- Remove every third element from the list.
- Replace every element that is a multiple of 5 with half of its value.
- This challenge will test your understanding of ListIterator methods like add(), remove(), and set(). It's like juggling with knives â€“ handle with care, but don't be afraid to show off.



- Challenge 2: Implement a Custom Iterable Collection
- Task: Implement your own Iterable collection of integers. 

- It should:
- Implement the Iterable interface.
- Provide a custom Iterator that iterates over the collection in reverse order.
- This is like building your own car from scratch. It will deepen your understanding of how iterators and iterables work under the hood. Remember, it's not just about making it work, it's about understanding why it works.



- Challenge 3: Multi-Threading with Safe Iteration
- Task: Create a multi-threaded application where:

- One thread continuously adds random numbers to a shared list.
- Another thread uses an iterator to traverse this list and sum the numbers.
- The catch is to do this in a thread-safe manner without causing a ConcurrentModificationException. This is the coding equivalent of defusing a bomb while riding a unicycle. You'll need to delve into synchronization and thread safety.
