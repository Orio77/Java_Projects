## Exercise on Creating Unmodifiable Collections:

**Task:** Create a list of strings representing a roster of players. Then, create an unmodifiable view of this list and attempt to add a new player to the unmodifiable list. Handle the resulting exception properly.

**Objective:** This exercise aims to solidify the student's understanding of how to create unmodifiable collections and handle exceptions arising from attempting to modify them.

## Comparative Exercise on Streams and Collections:

**Task:** Given a list of numbers, perform operations using Streams (like filtering, sorting) and then convert it to an unmodifiable collection. Illustrate the difference between the stream operations and the final unmodifiable collection.

**Objective:** To clearly differentiate between the operations done using Streams and the characteristics of the final collection, especially focusing on immutability.
