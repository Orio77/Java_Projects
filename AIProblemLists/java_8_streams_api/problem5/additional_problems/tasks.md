## Problem 1

Write a program that generates a stream of 50 random integers between 1 and 100 and calculates the sum of these numbers.

## Problem 2

Write a program that generates a stream of 100 random integers between 1 and 100, multiplies each number by 2, and then calculates the average of these transformed numbers.

## Problem 3

Write a program that generates a stream of 100 random integers between 1 and 100, filters out the numbers that are less than 50, and then calculates the average of the remaining numbers.
