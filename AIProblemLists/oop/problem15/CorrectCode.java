/*In this revised version, the compareTo method now compares the titles of the Book objects in a logical and consistent way. This approach is like using a ruler to measure length – simple, effective, and gives you a clear answer.

Recommendations
Understand the Comparable Interface: The student should understand that the Comparable interface is used to impose a natural ordering on the objects of each class that implements it. It's crucial for sorting objects, especially when using Java's built-in sorting methods.

Consistency in Comparison Logic: It's important to ensure that the comparison logic is consistent and predictable. Randomness has no place in a method that's meant to define an order. */


/*Misuse of Random in compareTo: The use of Random within compareTo is like trying to measure distance with a roulette wheel. The compareTo method should return a consistent result based on the properties of the objects being compared. Introducing randomness here is like trying to play chess with dice – it just doesn't make sense for sorting.

Redundant Book Field: The Book class has an instance variable Book book; which is unnecessary and unused. It's like packing an extra umbrella for a desert trip – it just adds weight without purpose.

Incorrect Usage of this Keyword: In compareTo, this.book.getTitle() should be this.getTitle(). The current usage is like calling your neighbor to ask what's in your fridge – unnecessary and confusing.

Sorting Logic: The sorting logic should be deterministic. For example, comparing titles alphabetically (lexicographically). This ensures a predictable and useful order.  */
