## Exercise on Constructor Chaining:

**Task:** Create a `Vehicle` class with multiple constructors. Implement a `Car` subclass that uses `this` and `super` to efficiently manage different constructor forms (e.g., default constructor, constructor with parameters).

**Objective:** This exercise aims to enhance the student's skills in constructor chaining and understanding the relationship between superclass and subclass constructors.

## Exercise on Method Overriding and Superclass Method Calls:

**Task:** Develop a `Shape` class with a method `draw()`. Then create subclasses like `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle`. Each subclass should override `draw()` to print specific details about the shape. Use `super.draw()` to include generic drawing steps from the `Shape` class.

**Objective:** This exercise is designed to deepen the student's practical understanding of method overriding and the use of `super` to incorporate superclass method logic.
