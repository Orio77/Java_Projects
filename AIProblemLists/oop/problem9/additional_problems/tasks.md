Objective: Learn to add more complexity to enums and how to use these enhanced enums in classes.

Exercise 2: Using Enums in a Library Management System
Problem Statement: Create a simple library management system where you can add books with different genres (using your Genre enum). Implement a method to search for books by genre and return a list of all books that match the given genre.

Objective: Understand how to use enums in real-world-like applications, practicing how to search and filter based on enum values.
