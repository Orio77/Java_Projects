**Scenario 2:** Build a tree-based document structure for a content management system.
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
1. **Task Refinement:** Replace 'Use recursion to traverse and manipulate the document tree' with 'Implement a tree traversal algorithm using recursion to navigate the document structure.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Create a function to traverse the tree using In-order, Pre-order, or Post-order traversal as needed.
        - Implement a method to print the content of each node during traversal for debugging purposes.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement features like adding, deleting, and rearranging content nodes' to 'Implement features like adding, deleting, and rearranging content nodes using tree operations.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Develop methods to add, delete, and rearrange nodes in the tree, maintaining the tree structure.
        - Ensure that the tree remains balanced after each operation to optimize traversal.
3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Ensure efficient tree operations for large documents' to 'Optimize tree operations for large documents using a self-balancing tree like an AVL tree.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Implement an AVL tree or similar self-balancing tree structure to maintain efficient operations as the document grows.
        - Test the performance of your tree operations with large documents to ensure efficiency.
