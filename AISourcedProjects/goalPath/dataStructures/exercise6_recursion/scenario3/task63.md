# Scenario 3: Develop a Recursive Function to Calculate Fibonacci Numbers Using Data Structures

## Task Refinements

### Task 1: Create a Java Function That Calculates Fibonacci Numbers Using Recursion and an Auxiliary Data Structure

**Actionable Transparency Instructions:**

1. Implement a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
2. Use an ArrayList or an array to store intermediate results during recursion.

### Task 2: Optimize the Recursive Function for Performance by Implementing Memoization Using a HashMap

**Actionable Transparency Instructions:**

1. Create a HashMap to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.
2. Before calculating a Fibonacci number, check if it is already in the HashMap to reduce unnecessary calculations.

### Task 3: Test the Function with Large Fibonacci Sequences and Analyze the Performance Improvement with Memoization

**Actionable Transparency Instructions:**

1. Test the function with large Fibonacci sequences and measure the execution time.
2. Compare the performance of the function with and without memoization to evaluate the effectiveness of your optimization.
