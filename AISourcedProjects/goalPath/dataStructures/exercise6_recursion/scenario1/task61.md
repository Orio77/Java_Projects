- **Scenario 1:** Create a maze-solving application that finds the shortest path from a start point to an exit.
	   - **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Replace 'Implement a recursive algorithm for maze traversal' with 'Implement a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm using Stack for maze traversal.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Create a Stack to keep track of the path from the start point.
            - Use the Stack to backtrack when a dead end is reached in the maze.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Handle backtracking to explore all possible paths' to 'Implement backtracking using Stack to explore all possible paths in the maze.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - When a dead end is reached, use the Stack to backtrack to the last junction.
            - Mark the paths that have been explored to avoid revisiting them.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Optimize the algorithm for efficiency in solving complex mazes' to 'Optimize the maze-solving algorithm using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) for finding the shortest path.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Implement a BFS algorithm using a Queue to find the shortest path in the maze.
            - Compare the efficiency of BFS and DFS in solving the maze.
