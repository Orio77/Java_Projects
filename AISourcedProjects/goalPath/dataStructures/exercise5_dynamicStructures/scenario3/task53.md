**Scenario 3:** Build a recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform.
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
1. **Task Refinement:** Replace 'Use dynamic data structures to store user preferences and product data' with 'Design a HashMap to store user preferences and an ArrayList to store product data.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Implement a HashMap where the key is the user ID and the value is a list of product categories they have shown interest in.
        - Use an ArrayList to store product data, with each product being an object containing details such as ID, category, and price.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement recommendation algorithms that adapt to user behavior' to 'Develop a recommendation algorithm using user preference data and product data.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Design an algorithm that iterates over the user's preference list and finds matching categories in the product data.
        - Implement a scoring system to rank products based on their relevance to the user's preferences.
3. **Task Refinement:** Modify 'Continuously update and refine recommendations based on user interactions' to 'Update user preferences and product recommendations based on user interactions using a Queue.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Implement a Queue to store recent user interactions, where each interaction updates the user's preference list.
        - Modify the recommendation algorithm to re-calculate product scores whenever the user's preference list is updated.


**Task Refinement:** Refine 'Develop a recommendation algorithm using user preference data and product data.' to 'Develop a recommendation algorithm using a graph data structure to represent user preference data and product data.'

**Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
- Design a graph where each node represents a product or a user. Edges between a user node and a product node represent the user's interest in that product.
- Implement a scoring system to rank products based on their relevance to the user's preferences. This can be done by assigning weights to the edges, where a higher weight indicates a higher interest.
- Use graph traversal algorithms to find products that are closely related to the user's preferences.
