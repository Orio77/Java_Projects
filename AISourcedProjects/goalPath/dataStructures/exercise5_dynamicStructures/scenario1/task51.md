**Scenario 1:** Create a text-based code editor with syntax highlighting.

1. **Task Refinement:** The task 'Use dynamic data structures like linked lists to manage lines of code' is relevant and remains unchanged.
- **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
    - Implement a doubly linked list where each node represents a line of code.
    - Develop methods to add, remove, and modify nodes in the linked list.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement syntax highlighting based on language-specific rules' to 'Implement syntax highlighting based on language-specific rules using a HashMap for efficient keyword lookup'.
- **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
    - Construct a HashMap with language-specific keywords and their corresponding colour codes.
    - Develop a function to highlight the code by searching for these keywords in the HashMap.
3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Ensure efficient editing and rendering of code' to 'Ensure efficient editing and rendering of code using a Buffer data structure'.
- **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
    - Implement a Buffer data structure to hold the visible lines of code for efficient rendering.
    - Develop methods to add, remove, and modify lines in the Buffer as the user scrolls or edits the code.
