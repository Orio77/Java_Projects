**==Problem 2: Route Planning==**
	
	**Scenario:** You are developing a GPS application. The application needs to provide the shortest route between two locations.
	
	**Tasks:**
	
	1. **Task:** Design a graph data structure to represent the map, where each node represents a location and each edge represents a road.
	    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
	        - Create a function to add a new location (node) to the map (graph).
	        - Create a function to add a new road (edge) between two locations (nodes).
	2. **Task:** Implement a function to find the shortest route between two given locations using Dijkstra's algorithm.
	    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
	        - Create a function that accepts two locations (nodes) as input and returns the shortest route (path) between them.
	        - Test the function with various location pairs to ensure it works correctly.
	3. **Task:** Implement a function to detect if there is a cycle in the map. This could be used to identify circular routes.
	    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
	        - Create a function that detects if there is a cycle in the graph.
	        - Test the function with various maps to ensure it works correctly.
