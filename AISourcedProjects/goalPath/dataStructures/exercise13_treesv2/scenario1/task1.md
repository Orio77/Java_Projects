**Refined Scenario 1:** Develop a hierarchical organizational chart for a company's intranet system using appropriate data structures, focusing on Trees, to represent the organization's hierarchy.

- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**

1. **Task Refinement:** Implement a Tree data structure, specifically a General Tree, to represent the organization's hierarchy where each node represents an employee and the links to child nodes represent direct reports.
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Understand the concept of General Trees and how they can represent hierarchical relationships.
        - Implement a General Tree, ensuring that each node contains information about an employee and links to their direct reports.
2. **Task Refinement:** Develop methods for easy additions, removals, and updates of employees (nodes) and departments (subtrees) in the organizational tree.
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Implement a method to add a new employee (node) to the tree under a specific manager (parent node).
        - Implement methods to remove an employee (node) from the tree and to update an employee's details.
3. **Task Refinement:** Remove 'Create a user-friendly interface for navigating and searching the organizational chart' as it diverges from the focus on Data Structures. Replace with 'Implement search functionality to find an employee in the organizational tree.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Understand tree traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
        - Implement a search function that uses either DFS or BFS to find an employee in the tree.
