- **Scenario 2:** Troubleshoot a performance bottleneck in a web application by analyzing data retrieval and manipulation in data structures.
	
 - **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks' to 'Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks in data retrieval and manipulation.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Use a profiler to identify which operations are taking the most time.
            - Identify if these operations are related to data retrieval or manipulation in data structures.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Analyze data structures and algorithms causing the slowdown' to 'Analyze the usage of data structures and their associated algorithms causing the slowdown.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Identify which data structures and algorithms are causing the performance issues.
            - Analyze if the data structures are being used efficiently and if the algorithms can be optimized.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Optimize the code to improve application performance' to 'Optimize the usage of data structures and their associated algorithms to improve application performance.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Implement optimizations for the identified data structures and algorithms.
            - Test the application to ensure the performance issues are resolved.
