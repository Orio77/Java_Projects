**Scenario 1:** Debug a Java application that crashes intermittently due to memory leaks in data structures.

- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Identify memory leak patterns using debugging tools' to 'Identify memory leak patterns in data structures using debugging tools.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Use a Java profiler to monitor the heap usage and garbage collection.
            - Identify which data structures are growing over time and not being cleaned up.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Analyze data structures and references causing the leak' to 'Analyze the usage of data structures and their references causing the leak.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Identify the data structures that are not being de-referenced properly.
            - Analyze the lifecycle of these data structures and where they are being referenced.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement fixes to resolve the memory leak issue' to 'Implement fixes to properly manage the lifecycle of data structures to resolve the memory leak issue.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Implement a strategy to ensure data structures are de-referenced when no longer needed.
            - Test the application to ensure the memory leak issue is resolved.
