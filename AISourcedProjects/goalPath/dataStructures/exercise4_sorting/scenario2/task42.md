# Scenario 2: Develop a conference scheduling application using Data Structures to manage and manipulate session data.
	
Sprint Tasks:
1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Use sorting algorithms to schedule sessions based on time slots and participant preferences' to 'Implement a priority queue to schedule sessions based on time slots and participant preferences.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Design a session class that includes properties for time slot and participant preferences.
        - Implement a priority queue where sessions are dequeued based on their time slot and participant preferences.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Handle conflicts and prioritize sessions effectively' to 'Handle session conflicts and prioritize sessions using appropriate data structure operations.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Develop a method to detect conflicts (two sessions scheduled at the same time).
        - Implement a conflict resolution strategy, such as rescheduling one of the conflicting sessions or prioritizing based on participant preferences.
3. **Task Removal:** Remove 'Provide a user-friendly schedule view for conference attendees' as it diverges from the focus on Data Structures. Replace with 'Implement a hash map to provide quick access to session information for conference attendees.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Construct a hash map where the key is the session ID and the value is the session object.
        - Develop a method to retrieve session information from the hash map using the session ID.
