**Scenario 3:** Design a leaderboard system for a gaming application.

1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement sorting algorithms to rank players based on their scores' to 'Implement a priority queue data structure to maintain a sorted leaderboard.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Construct a max priority queue where each entry represents a player and the priority is the player's score.
        - Develop a method to update the priority queue when a new score is added.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Update the leaderboard in real-time as new scores are submitted' to 'Design a queue data structure to handle real-time score submissions.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Implement a queue where each entry represents a new score submission.
        - Develop a method to dequeue a score submission and update the leaderboard.
3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Optimize leaderboard updates to minimize latency' to 'Optimize leaderboard updates using a HashMap.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Implement a HashMap where keys are player IDs and values are their scores.
        - Develop a method to update the HashMap and the leaderboard when a new score is submitted.
