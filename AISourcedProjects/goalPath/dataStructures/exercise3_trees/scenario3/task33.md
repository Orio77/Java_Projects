- Refined Sprint Tasks:

1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Create a decision tree data structure for representing choices and outcomes' to 'Implement a decision tree where each node represents a decision point and the branches represent possible choices.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Design a node class that can represent a decision point.
        - Implement a method to add child nodes to a parent node, representing the addition of new choices to a decision point.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement algorithms for traversing the decision tree and making recommendations' to 'Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for traversing the decision tree and making recommendations.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Develop a DFS algorithm to traverse the decision tree from the root to a leaf node, representing a complete decision path.
        - Implement a method to evaluate the outcome of a decision path and make a recommendation based on this evaluation.
3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Test the system with different decision scenarios' to 'Test the decision-making tool with various decision scenarios and validate the recommendations.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Create a set of test scenarios with known outcomes to validate the decision-making tool.
        - Implement a method to compare the tool's recommendations with the known outcomes and measure its accuracy.
