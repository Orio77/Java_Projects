1. Scenario 1: Construct a file system navigation tool using Data Structures to represent and manipulate files and folders.

- Refined Sprint Tasks:
1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Create a tree structure to represent directories and files' to 'Implement a tree data structure where each node represents a file or a directory.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Design a node class that can represent both files and directories.
        - Implement a method to add child nodes to a parent node, representing the creation of new files or directories.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement navigation and file operations like adding, deleting, and searching' to 'Implement file operations like adding, deleting, and searching using appropriate data structure methods.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Develop a method to add new nodes (files or directories) to the tree.
        - Create a method to delete nodes from the tree, ensuring all child nodes are also deleted.
        - Implement a search function that traverses the tree to find a specific file or directory.
3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Ensure efficient tree traversal for listing files and folders' to 'Implement a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm for efficient tree traversal.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Choose between DFS and BFS based on the expected depth and breadth of your file system tree.
        - Implement the chosen traversal algorithm to list files and directories.
