 2. Scenario 2: Develop a family tree application using Data Structures to represent and manipulate genealogical data.

- Refined Sprint Tasks:
1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Construct a binary tree to represent family relationships' to 'Implement a binary tree where each node represents a family member and the connections represent parent-child relationships.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Design a node class that can represent a family member.
        - Implement a method to add child nodes to a parent node, representing the addition of new family members.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement methods for adding new family members and querying relationships' to 'Implement methods for adding new family members and querying relationships using appropriate data structure operations.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Develop a method to add new nodes (family members) to the tree.
        - Create a method to search the tree for a specific family member and retrieve their immediate family relationships.
3. **Task Removal:** Remove 'Visualize the family tree using appropriate Java libraries' as it diverges from the focus on Data Structures. Replace with 'Implement a traversal method to list all family members in a given generation.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the tree by generation.
        - Develop a method to list all family members in a given generation using the BFS traversal.
