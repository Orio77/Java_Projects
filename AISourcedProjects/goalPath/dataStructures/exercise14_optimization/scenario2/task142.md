**Scenario 2:** Enhance the rendering speed of a 3D graphics application.
    
 - **Sprint Tasks:**
    
    1. Profile the graphics application to identify rendering bottlenecks.
    2. Optimize data structures and rendering algorithms for smoother animations.
    3. Test and benchmark the improved graphics performance on various hardware configurations.





Potential optimization points:

Object3D.render() method: This method is inefficient because it constructs a new string for each point every time it's called. This could be optimized by using a StringBuilder to construct the string, or by caching the string representation of the points.

GraphicsApplication.renderLoop() method: This method is inefficient because it constantly re-renders all objects, even if they haven't changed. This could be optimized by only re-rendering objects when they change.

Data structures: The application uses ArrayLists to store 3D objects and points. Depending on the use case, other data structures might be more efficient. For example, if objects are frequently added and removed, a LinkedList might be a better choice. If points are frequently accessed by index, an array might be more efficient.
