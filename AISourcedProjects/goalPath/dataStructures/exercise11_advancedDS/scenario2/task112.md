**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 2: Build a content recommendation system for a streaming platform, focusing on the use of advanced Data Structures and algorithms.
	
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
1. **Task Refinement:** Implement a Bloom filter data structure for efficient preliminary checks on whether a user has interacted with a piece of content before.
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Understand the concept of Bloom filters and how they can be used for preliminary checks in recommendation systems.
        - Implement the Bloom filter data structure in Java, ensuring it correctly identifies whether a user has interacted with a piece of content before.
2. **Task Refinement:** Implement a MinHash data structure for efficient calculation of Jaccard similarity between different content, aiding in content-based recommendation.
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Understand the concept of MinHash and how it can be used for similarity calculations.
        - Implement the MinHash data structure in Java, ensuring it correctly calculates Jaccard similarity between different content.
3. **Task Refinement:** Implement a Priority Queue data structure to continuously update and fine-tune recommendations for users, prioritizing content with higher predicted user ratings.
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Understand how a Priority Queue data structure can be used to manage updates to recommendations, prioritizing certain content.
        - Implement the Priority Queue data structure in Java, ensuring it correctly manages updates to recommendations and prioritizes content based on predicted user ratings.
