==**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1==: Develop a geographic mapping application with features like routing and location-based services, focusing on the use of specific Data Structures.
	
  - **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Implement a Quad-tree data structure for efficient spatial indexing of the map's data.
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Study the concept of Quad-tree and how it can be used for spatial indexing.
            - Implement the Quad-tree data structure in Java, ensuring it correctly indexes spatial data such as coordinates for locations.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Implement a Graph data structure and Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient route planning between two points on the map.
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Understand how a Graph data structure can represent locations as nodes and routes as edges.
            - Implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Java to find the shortest path between two nodes in the graph.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Optimize the Quad-tree and Graph data structures for efficient memory usage and processing.
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Analyze the memory usage of your Quad-tree and Graph implementations.
            - Implement optimizations such as pruning unnecessary nodes in the Quad-tree and reducing edge weights in the Graph to improve the performance of the application.
