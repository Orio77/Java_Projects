**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 3: Design a real-time analytics dashboard for monitoring website traffic and user behavior, focusing on the use of specific Data Structures.

- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
1. **Task Refinement:** Implement a HyperLogLog data structure for efficient approximate cardinality estimation of unique website visitors.
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Understand the concept of HyperLogLog and how it can be used for approximate cardinality estimation.
        - Implement the HyperLogLog data structure in Java, ensuring it correctly estimates the number of unique website visitors.
2. **Task Refinement:** Implement a Queue data structure for real-time data processing pipelines and event aggregation.
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Understand how a Queue data structure can be used for real-time data processing and event aggregation.
        - Implement the Queue data structure in Java, ensuring it correctly manages real-time data processing and event aggregation.
3. **Task Removal:** Remove 'Visualize analytics data in an interactive and responsive dashboard' as it diverges from the focus on Data Structures. Replace with 'Implement a Hash Map data structure to store and retrieve user behavior data efficiently.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Understand how a Hash Map data structure can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently.
        - Implement the Hash Map data structure in Java, ensuring it correctly stores and retrieves user behavior data.
