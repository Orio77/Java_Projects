# Analysis 2: Proposed Improvements

## 1. ID Generation
Switch to a more reliable ID generation strategy to ensure unique and consistent identifiers for your entities.

## 2. Remove Redundant Classes
Consider removing the `OrderID` and `ProductID` classes if they are not providing additional value beyond what a simple ID field would provide.

## 3. Optimize Data Structures
Use a `HashMap` for `ProductStore` to improve lookup times. Also, ensure the queue in `OrderManager` is properly initialized to prevent null pointer exceptions.

## 4. Refactor Singleton
Reconsider the use of the singleton pattern for your `Data` class. If multiple instances are not causing issues and there's no shared state, a singleton might not be necessary.

## 5. Add Main Class
Implement a main class to tie everything together. This class should be responsible for initializing your system and starting the application.

## 6. Documentation and Error Handling
Add comments to your code for better clarity and understanding. Implement error handling to make your code more robust and prevent it from crashing due to unexpected inputs or states.
