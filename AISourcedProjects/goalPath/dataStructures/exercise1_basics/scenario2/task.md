**Scenario 2:** Design an inventory tracking system for an e-commerce website. The system should be capable of managing the inventory of products, processing incoming orders, and retrieving data efficiently.

**Sprint Tasks:**

1. Develop a system to manage product inventory. This system should be capable of adding new products, removing products, and updating the quantity of existing products. The data structure used should be dynamic, meaning it should be able to grow and shrink in size as needed.

2. Implement a system for processing incoming orders. This system should be able to handle multiple orders at once and process them in the order they are received. The data structure used should be a queue, meaning it should follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

3. Optimize the system for data retrieval. The system should be able to quickly and efficiently retrieve data about products and orders. The data structures used should be chosen specifically for their efficiency in data retrieval.
