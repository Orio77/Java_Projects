# Code Review: Playlist Management - Java Style

Let's dive into your Java-based playlist management system and turn up the heat!

## Key Points

1. **String Comparison in 'removeSong'**: In Java, `==` checks memory addresses, not content. Use `song.getTitle().equals(title)` to compare strings, or `Objects.equals(song.getTitle(), title)` to be null-safe.

2. **Concurrent Modification in 'removeSong'**: Modifying a list while iterating through it can lead to a `ConcurrentModificationException`. Use `iterator.remove()` after `iterator.next()` to safely remove items.

3. **Playlist Indexing**: If your playlist mimics Spotify's 1-based indexing, clarify this non-standard choice with comments. Adjust the `removeSong(int position)` method to correctly map user input to zero-based Java indexing.

4. **Shuffle Method**: Your shuffle method adds songs to random positions without removing the original, duplicating them. Consider using `Collections.shuffle(playlist)` for a more elegant and error-free shuffle.

5. **Encapsulation**: Control access to your playlist field through public methods instead of leaving it with package-private access.

6. **Absence of Song Equality**: Implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` in your Song class to enable proper comparison and hash-based collections usage.

7. **Error Handling**: Your code lacks error handling for scenarios like removing non-existent songs. Add checks and throw meaningful exceptions or handle such cases gracefully.

8. **Testing with Non-Existent Song**: Ensure your code handles cases of non-existent songs without causing unexpected behavior.

## Personalized Improvement Tips

1. **String Handling**: Understand and master string comparisons in Java. Experiment with different string methods, including `equals()`, `equalsIgnoreCase()`, and `startsWith()`.

2. **Data Structures**: Deep dive into Java Collections, especially `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, and `HashSet`. Implement custom data structures like stacks or queues and understand their underlying mechanisms.

3. **Error Handling**: Embrace robust error handling. Regularly use try-catch blocks and custom exceptions in your code.

## Personalized Warnings

1. **Overcomplicating Logic**: Avoid overcomplicating solutions. 

2. **Neglecting Best Practices**: Always follow Java best practices, especially in naming conventions and class structure.

3. **Forgetting the Basics**: Donâ€™t get lost in advanced concepts and forget the basics.
