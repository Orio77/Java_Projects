# Text Editor Development: Issues and Improvements

## Issues

### 1. Stack Initialization
The `history` and `undoHistory` stacks are currently uninitialized, leading to potential NullPointerExceptions. These stacks should be initialized in the constructor.

### 2. Text Addition
The `addText` method currently concatenates text with a hardcoded space, limiting flexibility. Consider using a StringBuilder or allowing the user to specify the text merging behavior.

### 3. Memory Management in `removeText` and `modifyText`
Setting `undoHistory` to null after changes discards valuable history. Instead of setting it to null, consider clearing or resetting `undoHistory` when making a new change to text.

### 4. `modifyText` Method Behavior
The `modifyText` method currently overwrites any text with "modified text". This behavior is too restrictive. Consider providing a way to pass in the new text or perform a more meaningful modification.

### 5. Stack Empty Checks
The `undo` and `redo` methods currently do not check if the stacks are empty before popping, which can lead to exceptions. Always check if the stack is empty before popping.

### 6. Efficiency of Storing Text Changes
Storing the entire text string on each change is inefficient. Consider storing just the changes (deltas), not the whole text.

### 7. Boundary Cases in `removeText`
The `removeText` method uses `substring` without checking if `characterToLeave` is within bounds, which can lead to `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Always check the bounds before using `substring`.

### 8. Missing `redo` Logic
The `redo` method currently does not handle scenarios where there's nothing to redo. Ensure that it correctly handles these scenarios.

### 9. Handling of Consecutive Operations
The system currently does not differentiate between consecutive undos/redos and new text changes. This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.

### 10. Visibility of `addToHistory` and `addToUndoHistory`
The `addToHistory` and `addToUndoHistory` methods are currently public, but they seem more like internal workings of the class. Consider making these methods private to encapsulate the functionality.
