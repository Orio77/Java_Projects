# Scenario 3: Text Editor Development with Undo/Redo Functionality

## Objective
The goal is to develop a simple text editor that includes undo and redo functionality.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Change History Tracking System
The first task is to design a system that tracks the history of text changes. This system should:

- Record every change made to the text, including additions, deletions, and modifications.
- Store each change as a separate entry in the history.

### Task 2: Undo and Redo Operations
The second task is to implement undo and redo operations. These operations should:

- Allow the undo operation to revert the text to its state before the most recent change.
- Enable the redo operation to reapply a change that has been undone.
- Handle multiple consecutive undo or redo actions.

### Task 3: Boundary Cases and Edge Scenarios
The third task is to handle boundary cases and edge scenarios effectively. This includes:

- Managing scenarios where an attempt is made to undo when there are no changes to undo.
- Handling cases where an attempt is made to redo when there are no changes to redo.
- Efficiently handling large amounts of text and rapid sequences of changes.
