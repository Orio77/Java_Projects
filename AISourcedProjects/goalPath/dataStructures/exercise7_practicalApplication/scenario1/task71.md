**Scenario 1**: Develop a contact management system for a mobile application that uses efficient data structures to add, edit, and organize contacts
    
1. **Task Removal:** Remove 'Create a user-friendly interface for managing contacts' as it diverges from the focus on Data Structures. Replace with 'Design a data structure to store contact information.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Choose an appropriate data structure (like an ArrayList or LinkedList) to store contact information.
        - Implement methods to add, edit, and delete contacts from this data structure.
2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Use data structures like lists or arrays to store contact information efficiently' to 'Implement a HashMap to store contact information for efficient retrieval.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Use the contact's name as the key and the contact details as the value in the HashMap.
        - Implement a hashCode() method to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of contact information.
3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement features like contact search and sorting' to 'Implement a search function using binary search and a sorting function using a sorting algorithm appropriate for your data structure.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Implement a binary search function to search for contacts by name.
        - Implement a sorting function to sort contacts by name, using a sorting algorithm that is efficient for your chosen data structure.
