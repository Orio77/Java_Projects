**Scenario 3**: Develop a chat application that uses efficient data structures to manage group chats and message history.

**Refined Sprint Tasks:**
1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Use data structures to manage chat messages and conversations' to 'Design a data structure, such as a LinkedList, to store chat messages in each conversation.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Each node in the LinkedList represents a chat message.
        - Implement methods to add new messages to the LinkedList and to retrieve a specific message.
2. **Task Removal:** Remove 'Implement real-time message updates and notifications' as it diverges from the focus on Data Structures. Replace with 'Implement a HashMap to map each user to their active conversations.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Use the user's ID as the key and a list of conversation IDs as the value in the HashMap.
        - Implement methods to add and remove conversations from a user's active conversations.
3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Ensure efficient storage and retrieval of chat history' to 'Implement a Stack data structure to store the chat history for each conversation.'
    - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
        - Each element in the Stack represents a message in the chat history.
        - Implement methods to push new messages onto the Stack and to pop messages off the Stack when retrieving the chat history.
