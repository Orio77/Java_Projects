**Scenario 2**: Develop a task management tool for project teams that uses efficient data structures to track tasks, deadlines, and dependencies.

- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Design data structures to represent tasks and their relationships' to 'Design a Graph data structure to represent tasks and their dependencies.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Each node in the graph represents a task, and an edge represents a dependency between tasks.
            - Implement methods to add tasks (nodes) and dependencies (edges) to the graph.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Implement task assignment, progress tracking, and notifications' to 'Implement a HashMap to track task assignment and progress.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Use the task ID as the key and the task status as the value in the HashMap.
            - Implement methods to update the task status in the HashMap when a task is assigned or its progress changes.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Refine 'Optimize task retrieval and display for effective project management' to 'Implement a PriorityQueue to manage tasks based on their deadlines.'
        - **Actionable Transparency Instructions:**
            - Each task is inserted into the PriorityQueue with a priority based on its deadline.
            - Implement a method to retrieve the next task to work on, which is the task with the highest priority (i.e., the earliest deadline) in the PriorityQueue.
