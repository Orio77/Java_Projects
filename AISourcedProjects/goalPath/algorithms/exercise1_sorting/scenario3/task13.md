**Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Develop a task prioritization feature using QuickSort for users dealing with numerous tasks.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement the QuickSort algorithm to sort tasks based on their priority levels in descending order (highest priority first).
            - Test the QuickSort implementation by checking if the tasks are correctly sorted in order of their priority.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Implement MergeSort for creating custom task categories and sorting tasks within each category.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Develop the MergeSort algorithm to sort tasks into categories based on multiple attributes like due date, priority, and task type.
            - Validate the MergeSort implementation by checking if the tasks are correctly sorted into their respective categories.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Demonstrate the efficiency of BubbleSort in a tutorial on sorting a to-do list.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement the BubbleSort algorithm to sort a simple to-do list of 10 tasks by due date in ascending order.
            - Prepare a step-by-step explanation of how BubbleSort works using this small to-do list as an example.
