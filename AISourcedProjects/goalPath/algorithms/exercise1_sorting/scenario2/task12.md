**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 2: Enhancing Social Media Feed Experience through Efficient Sorting and Searching Algorithms
 - **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
 
1. **Task Refinement:** Implement InsertionSort to maintain a chronological order of user posts in a user's feed.
	- **Actionable Instructions:**
		- Code the InsertionSort algorithm to sort user posts based on their timestamps in descending order (most recent first).
		- Test the InsertionSort implementation by checking if the posts are correctly sorted in chronological order.
2. **Task Refinement:** Use SelectionSort to sort a small set of user posts for educational purposes, explaining its basic concept to your followers.
	- **Actionable Instructions:**
		- Implement the SelectionSort algorithm to sort a simple array of 10 user posts based on their likes in ascending order.
		- Prepare a step-by-step explanation of how SelectionSort works using this small set of user posts as an example.
3. **Task Refinement:** Optimize search functionality with Binary Search to quickly find specific user profiles.
	- **Actionable Instructions:**
		- Implement the Binary Search algorithm to search for user profiles based on their usernames in a sorted list of usernames.
		- Validate the Binary Search implementation by checking if it correctly finds the specified user profiles in the sorted list.
