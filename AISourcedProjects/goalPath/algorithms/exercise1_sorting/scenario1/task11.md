**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1: Enhancing E-commerce Product Listing Efficiency and User Experience through Advanced Sorting Algorithms
  - **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Implement QuickSort to sort the e-commerce product inventory. Focus on optimizing the pivot selection to handle diverse price ranges.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Code the QuickSort algorithm with a strategy for choosing an effective pivot, such as the median-of-three method.
            - Test the QuickSort implementation with a diverse set of product prices to ensure it works efficiently.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Apply MergeSort for categorizing products, enhancing the filter system's responsiveness and accuracy.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Develop the MergeSort algorithm to sort products into categories based on multiple attributes like price, popularity, and ratings.
            - Validate the MergeSort implementation by checking if the products are correctly sorted into their respective categories.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Use BubbleSort to sort a small inventory of products by price - for practise
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement the BubbleSort algorithm to sort a simple array of 100 elements by price in ascending order.
            - Verify the BubbleSort implementation by checking if the array is correctly sorted in ascending order.
