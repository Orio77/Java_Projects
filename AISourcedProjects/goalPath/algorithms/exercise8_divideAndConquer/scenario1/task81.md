**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1: Optimizing Investment Portfolio using Divide and Conquer Strategies
    
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Implement a divide and conquer algorithm to optimize asset allocation in a diverse portfolio. This involves dividing the portfolio into smaller subsets, optimizing each subset, and then combining the results.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the divide and conquer strategy, focusing on how it breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem independently, and combines the results.
            - Implement the divide and conquer strategy in Java, ensuring to handle edge cases like empty portfolios and portfolios with a single asset.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Utilize divide and conquer for efficient risk management and return optimization. This involves dividing the portfolio based on risk levels or potential returns, optimizing each subset, and then combining the results.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement a function to divide the portfolio based on risk levels or potential returns. This can be done by sorting the assets based on their risk levels or potential returns and then dividing the sorted list into subsets.
            - Implement a function to optimize each subset. This could involve selecting the assets with the highest potential returns for each risk level.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Address complex financial problems, such as solving intricate arithmetic calculations. This involves implementing efficient algorithms for performing these calculations.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Identify the complex arithmetic calculations that need to be performed. This could involve calculations like compound interest, net present value, etc.
            - Implement efficient algorithms for performing these calculations. This could involve using built-in Java functions or implementing custom functions.
