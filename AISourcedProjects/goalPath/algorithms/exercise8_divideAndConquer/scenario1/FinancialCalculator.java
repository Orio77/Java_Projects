/*1. **Implementing Divide and Conquer for Portfolio Optimization:**
    
    - The portfolio is divided into smaller subsets. This could be done by splitting the portfolio into two halves.
    - Each subset is optimized independently. This could involve finding the best asset allocation for each subset to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
    - The results from each subset are then combined to get the optimal asset allocation for the entire portfolio.
2. **Utilizing Divide and Conquer for Risk Management and Return Optimization:**
    
    - The portfolio is divided based on risk levels or potential returns. This could be done by sorting the assets based on their risk levels or potential returns and then dividing the sorted list into subsets.
    - Each subset is optimized independently. This could involve selecting the assets with the highest potential returns for each risk level.
    - The results from each subset are then combined to get the optimal asset allocation for the entire portfolio.
3. **Addressing Complex Financial Problems:**
    
    - Identify the complex arithmetic calculations that need to be performed. This could involve calculations like compound interest, net present value, etc.
    - Implement efficient algorithms for performing these calculations. This could involve using built-in Java functions or implementing custom functions. */
