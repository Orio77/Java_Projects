**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1: Optimizing Resource Allocation in a Data Center using Dynamic Programming and Load Balancing Algorithms
    
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Apply dynamic programming to create an algorithm that minimizes the total processing time of tasks across servers. This involves determining an optimal sequence of tasks for each server.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Define the state of the dynamic programming solution (e.g., the remaining capacity of each server and the remaining tasks).
            - Define the decision space (e.g., which task to assign to which server).
            - Define the transition function that updates the state based on the decisions.
            - Implement the dynamic programming solution using a bottom-up approach, filling up a memoization table.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Implement memoization to store the results of subproblems in the dynamic programming solution. This involves creating a data structure (e.g., a 2D array) to store the optimal sequence of tasks for each possible state.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Initialize a data structure to store the results of subproblems.
            - Before computing the result of a subproblem, check if it is already stored in the data structure.
            - If the result of a subproblem is already stored, retrieve it from the data structure instead of recomputing it.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Implement a load balancing algorithm to ensure a fair distribution of tasks among servers. This involves assigning tasks to servers in a way that minimizes the maximum load on any server.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Define the load of a server as the total processing time of its tasks.
            - Implement a greedy algorithm that assigns each task to the server with the minimum load.
            - Implement a priority queue to efficiently find the server with the minimum load.
