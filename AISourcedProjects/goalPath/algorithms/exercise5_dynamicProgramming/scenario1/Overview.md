1. **Dynamic Programming Algorithm:**
    
    - Initialize a 3D array `dp[i][j][k]` where `i` represents the current task, `j` represents the remaining capacity of server 1, and `k` represents the remaining capacity of server 2. The value of `dp[i][j][k]` will represent the minimum total processing time when we are at task `i` with `j` and `k` remaining capacities for server 1 and server 2 respectively.
    - For each task, iterate over all possible remaining capacities for both servers. If the task can be assigned to a server (i.e., its processing time is less than the remaining capacity of the server), make a decision: either assign the task to server 1, or assign it to server 2, or do not assign the task to any server. Update the `dp` array based on these decisions.
    - The minimum total processing time will be the minimum value in the `dp` array after considering all tasks.
2. **Memoization:**
    
    - Before computing the value of `dp[i][j][k]`, check if it has already been computed and stored in the `dp` array.
    - If it has, retrieve the value from the `dp` array instead of recomputing it.
3. **Load Balancing Algorithm:**
    
    - Initialize a priority queue of servers, where the priority is based on the load of a server (i.e., the total processing time of its tasks). The server with the minimum load has the highest priority.
    - For each task, assign it to the server with the highest priority (i.e., the server with the minimum load). After assigning the task, update the load of the server and its position in the priority queue.
