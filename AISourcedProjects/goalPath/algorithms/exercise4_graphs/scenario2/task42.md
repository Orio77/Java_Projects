**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 2: Enhancing Social Network Friend Recommendations through Graph Algorithms
 - **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Apply graphs to model the social connections among users. This task will help you understand how to use graphs to represent complex networks.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Model the social network as a graph where nodes represent users and edges represent friendships.
            - Test the graph with different sets of users and friendships to ensure it accurately represents the social network.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Utilize Prim's Algorithm to suggest potential friend connections based on mutual friends. This task will help you understand how to use minimum spanning tree algorithms in a practical context.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement Prim's algorithm considering the social network as a graph where nodes represent users and edges represent friendships with weights as the number of mutual friends.
            - Test the algorithm with different sets of users and friendships to ensure it always suggests the most relevant potential friends.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) for identifying clusters of users with similar interests or backgrounds. This task will help you understand how to use graph traversal algorithms in a practical context.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement BFS algorithm considering the social network as a graph where nodes represent users and edges represent friendships.
            - Test the algorithm with different sets of users and friendships to ensure it always finds all clusters of users with similar interests or backgrounds.
