/*2. **Develop a Function to Perform Atomic Register Updates:**
    
    - Understand the concept of atomic operations and why they are important for register access. Atomic operations are operations that are completed in a single step without the possibility of interruption.
    - Implement a function to perform atomic register updates. This could involve using hardware features like a lock or disabling interrupts during the operation to ensure that the read-modify-write operation is not interrupted. */
