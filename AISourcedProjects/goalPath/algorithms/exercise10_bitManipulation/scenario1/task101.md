- **Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1: Developing Hardware Drivers for Embedded Systems
    
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Implement bit manipulation techniques for reading and writing device registers. This involves using bitwise operations to set, clear, or toggle specific bits in a register.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Define a set of constants or macros representing the bit positions or masks for the register fields.
            - Implement functions to read a register field (using bitwise AND and shift operations), write to a register field (using bitwise AND, OR, and shift operations), and toggle a register field (using bitwise XOR operation).
    2. **Task Refinement:** Develop a function to perform atomic register updates. This involves ensuring that read-modify-write operations on the register are not interrupted.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the concept of atomic operations and why they are important for register access.
            - Implement a function to perform atomic register updates, possibly using hardware features or disabling interrupts during the operation.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Implement a driver for a specific hardware device, such as a GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) device. This involves writing functions to initialize the device, set the device configuration, and read from or write to the device.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the specifications of the device, including the purpose and layout of its registers.
            - Implement the device driver in C, using the bit manipulation techniques and atomic register update function developed in the previous tasks.
