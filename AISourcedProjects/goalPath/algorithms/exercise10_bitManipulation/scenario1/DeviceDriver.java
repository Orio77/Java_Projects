/*3. **Implement a Driver for a Specific Hardware Device:**
    
    - Understand the specifications of the device, including the purpose and layout of its registers.
    - Implement the device driver in C. This could involve writing functions to initialize the device, set the device configuration, and read from or write to the device. The bit manipulation techniques and atomic register update function developed in the previous tasks would be used in these functions. */
