**Scenario 2: Bitwise Operations on Binary Numbers**

**Task 1: Bit Manipulation for Binary Number Processing**

- Enhance a binary number by manipulating its bits using bitwise operations. The main focus here is to understand how bitwise operations can affect the value of a binary number.
- _Potential input_: A binary number represented as a string, e.g., "101010".
- _Desired Output_: A binary number represented as a string after performing a bitwise operation, e.g., "010101" after performing a bitwise NOT operation.
- _Coach Suggestions_: Start by understanding how binary numbers work. Then, experiment with bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift left, and shift right to see how they affect the binary number.

**Task 2: Implement Binary Number Compression**

- Implement a simple compression algorithm on a binary number using bitwise operations. The main focus here is to understand how bitwise operations can be used to reduce the size of a binary number without losing any information.
- _Potential input_: A binary number represented as a string, e.g., "11111111".
- _Desired Output_: A compressed representation of the binary number, e.g., "1(8)" indicating that '1' is repeated 8 times.
- _Coach Suggestions_: Research about simple compression techniques like Run-Length Encoding (RLE). Implement this technique using bitwise operations to compress the binary number.

**Task 3: Explore Bitwise Logic in Reducing Binary Number Sizes**

- Explore how bitwise logic can be used to reduce binary number sizes without significant information loss. The main focus here is to understand the trade-off between information and size when using compression techniques.
- _Potential input_: A binary number represented as a string, e.g., "10101010".
- _Desired Output_: A compressed representation of the binary number with reduced size, e.g., "10(4)" indicating that '10' is repeated 4 times.
- _Coach Suggestions_: Research about simple compression techniques. Understand how these techniques use patterns and repetition to reduce size. Implement a simple version of these techniques using bitwise operations.
