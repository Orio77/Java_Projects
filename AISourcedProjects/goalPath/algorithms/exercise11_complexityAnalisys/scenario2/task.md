Generate a piece of code in core Java that simulates what exercise describes. The code should be moderately complex and of medium length, approximately 100 lines. It should include deliberate, non-obvious optimization opportunities. These opportunities should not be basic algorithm replacements (like changing bubble sort to quicksort or linear search to binary search). Instead, they should require more intricate understanding of the code's functionality and potential efficiency improvements. Please include comments in the code indicating where and why these optimizations can be made, but do not implement the optimizations yourself. Additionally, provide a brief explanation of the code’s purpose and a summary of the potential optimization points.

1. In the constructor, items and obstacles are placed randomly on the grid. This process can be optimized by keeping track of the empty cells and selecting from them randomly, instead of randomly selecting any cell and checking if it's empty. This would avoid potential wasted iterations where the randomly selected cell is not empty.
2. The `movePlayer` method checks if the new position is within the grid and not an obstacle. This check could be optimized by maintaining a separate list of valid moves for the player. This list would be updated whenever the player moves or an item is collected.
3. The `printGrid` method prints the grid by iterating over all cells. This could be optimized by keeping track of the changes in the grid and only printing those. However, this would require a more complex data structure to keep track of the changes.



1. The `processEvent` method uses a switch statement to process events based on their type. This could be optimized by using a `HashMap` to map event types to their corresponding processing methods. This would avoid the need for a large switch statement and allow for constant time lookups instead of linear time lookups.
2. The `runSimulation` method processes all events in the queue one by one. This could be optimized by using multiple threads to process events concurrently. However, this would require careful synchronization to ensure that events are processed in the correct order.
3. The `addEvent` method adds events to the queue without any checks. This could be optimized by checking if the event is valid before adding it to the queue. For example, it could check if the event's timestamp is in the future. This would avoid wasting time processing invalid events.
