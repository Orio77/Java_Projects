**Refined Scenario 1: Optimizing GPS Navigation with Efficient Search Algorithms**
	
  1. **Task Refinement:** Implement Binary Search to efficiently locate points of interest in a sorted database.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Code the Binary Search algorithm to search through the sorted database of points of interest.
        - Test the algorithm with various search queries to ensure it works correctly.
  2. **Task Refinement:** Develop a feature that uses Linear Search to find nearby gas stations in a user-friendly manner.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement the Linear Search algorithm to search through an unsorted list of nearby gas stations.
        - Design the feature in a way that is easy for users to understand and use.
  3. **Task Refinement:** Explore the use of Depth-First Search (DFS) for optimizing route planning in complex road networks.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement the DFS algorithm to plan routes through a graph representing a complex road network.
        - Test the algorithm with various start and end points to ensure it finds the optimal route.
