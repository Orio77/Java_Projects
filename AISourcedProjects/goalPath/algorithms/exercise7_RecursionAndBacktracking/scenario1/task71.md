**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1: Developing Recursive and Backtracking Algorithms for Puzzle Solving
    
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Implement a recursive solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. This involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, with the constraint that a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the recursive solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which involves moving n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.
            - Implement the recursive solution in Java, ensuring to handle the base case of moving a single disk.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Develop recursive algorithms for generating permutations and combinations of puzzle pieces. This involves generating all possible arrangements of puzzle pieces and all possible selections of puzzle pieces, respectively.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement a recursive function to generate permutations of puzzle pieces. This can be done by swapping each piece with each other piece and recursively generating permutations of the remaining pieces.
            - Implement a recursive function to generate combinations of puzzle pieces. This can be done by selecting each piece and recursively generating combinations of the remaining pieces.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Use backtracking to solve the N-Queens puzzle and maze navigation challenges. This involves placing queens on a chess board such that no two queens threaten each other, and finding a path from the start of a maze to the end.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the backtracking algorithm for the N-Queens puzzle, which involves placing queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When placing a queen in a column, check for clashes with already placed queens. If a clash is found, then we skip this position and move to the next one. If no position can be found in the current column, then we return false. If we have placed all the queens successfully, that means we have found a solution.
            - Implement the backtracking solution in Java, ensuring to handle the base case of placing a single queen.
            - Understand the backtracking algorithm for maze navigation, which involves starting from the top-left corner of the maze and moving in all four directions (up, down, left, right) one step at a time. If a path is found, return true. If no path is found after moving in all four directions, then backtrack and return false.
            - Implement the backtracking solution for maze navigation in Java, ensuring to handle the base case of reaching the end of the maze.
