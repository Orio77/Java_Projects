- Enhanced task 1 with clear and transparent instruction. Main focus of the task is given by the user topic
    
- **Task**: Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. Factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using recursion.
- _Potential input_: A positive integer. For example: `n = 5`.
- _Desired Output_: The factorial of the input number.
- _Coach Suggestions_: Start by understanding the base case and the recursive case of the factorial function. The base case is `n = 0`, where the result is `1`. The recursive case is `n * factorial(n - 1)`. Implement a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number. Remember to include a condition to handle the base case.

- Enhanced task 2 with clear and transparent instruction. Main focus of the task is given by the user topic
    
- **Task**: Implement a recursive function to generate all permutations of a string. A permutation refers to the rearrangement of all the characters in the string in all possible orders.
- _Potential input_: A string. For example: `s = "abc"`.
- _Desired Output_: All permutations of the input string.
- _Coach Suggestions_: Start by swapping the first character with each of the characters including itself. Then, recursively generate all permutations of the remaining characters. The base case is when the input string is empty or contains a single character, in which case return the string itself. Implement a recursive function that generates all permutations of a string. Remember to include a condition to handle the base case.

- Enhanced task 3 with clear and transparent instruction. Main focus of the task is given by the user topic
    
- **Task**: Implement a recursive function to generate a tree structure. Each node of the tree should contain a value and a list of its children. Your goal is to create a tree with a specified depth and number of children per node.
- _Potential input_: The depth of the tree and the number of children per node. For example: `depth = 3`, `num_children = 2`.
- _Desired Output_: A tree structure with the specified depth and number of children per node.
- _Coach Suggestions_: Start by creating the root node. Then, recursively create the children for each node until the specified depth is reached. The base case is when the depth is 0, in which case return the node without creating any children. Implement a recursive function that generates a tree structure. Remember to include a condition to handle the base case.
