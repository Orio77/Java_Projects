**Refined Scenario 2: Enhancing Social Network Profile Management with Efficient Data Structures**

	**Refined Sprint Tasks:**

 1. **Task Refinement:** Utilize graphs to represent the network of user connections.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement a graph data structure to represent the network of user connections.
        - Develop a feature to visualize the graph, showing the relationships between different users.
        - Test the implementation with various user networks to ensure it represents and visualizes correctly.
 2. **Task Refinement:** Implement linked lists for user posts and comments.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement a linked list to manage user posts and comments dynamically, allowing for additions and removals.
        - Develop a feature to display the linked list, showing the sequence of posts and comments.
        - Test the implementation with various posts and comments to ensure it manages and displays correctly.
 3. **Task Refinement:** Create queues for handling real-time notifications and messages.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement a queue to handle real-time notifications and messages, ensuring they are processed in the order they arrive.
        - Develop a feature to display the queue, showing the sequence of notifications and messages.
        - Test the implementation with various notifications and messages to ensure it handles and displays correctly.
