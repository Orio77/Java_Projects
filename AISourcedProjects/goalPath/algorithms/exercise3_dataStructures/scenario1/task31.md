**Refined Scenario 1: Enhancing Financial Portfolio Tracker with Efficient Data Structures**
	
  - **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
	
 1. **Task Refinement:** Use arrays and linked lists to store and manage diverse investment assets.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement arrays to store a fixed number of diverse investment assets.
        - Use linked lists to manage assets dynamically, allowing for additions and removals of assets.
        - Test the implementation with various operations to ensure it works correctly.
 2. **Task Refinement:** Implement trees to visualize hierarchical portfolio structures.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement a tree data structure to represent the hierarchical structure of the portfolio.
        - Develop a feature to visualize the tree structure, showing the relationships between different assets.
        - Test the implementation with various portfolio structures to ensure it visualizes correctly.
 3. **Task Refinement:** Apply stacks and queues for tracking transaction history and performance metrics.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement a stack to keep track of the transaction history, allowing for operations like undo and redo.
        - Use a queue to calculate performance metrics over a rolling time period.
        - Test the implementation with various transactions and metrics to ensure it tracks correctly.
