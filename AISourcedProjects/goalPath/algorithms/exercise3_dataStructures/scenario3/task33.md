**Refined Scenario 3: Enhancing Online Bookstore Inventory Management with Efficient Data Structures**
	
	- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**

 1. **Task Refinement:** Utilize arrays and linked lists to manage book catalog data.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement arrays to store a fixed number of book catalog data.
        - Use linked lists to manage book catalog data dynamically, allowing for additions and removals of books.
        - Test the implementation with various operations to ensure it works correctly.
 2. **Task Refinement:** Implement a binary search tree for optimizing book recommendations.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement a binary search tree to store book data, with the tree organized by a relevant metric (such as book ratings or popularity) for recommendations.
        - Develop a feature to traverse the tree and generate book recommendations.
        - Test the implementation with various book data to ensure it recommends correctly.
 3. **Task Refinement:** Use stacks and queues to handle book orders and inventory updates.
    - **Actionable Instructions:**
        - Implement a stack to keep track of the book orders, allowing for operations like undo and redo.
        - Use a queue to handle inventory updates, ensuring they are processed in the order they arrive.
        - Test the implementation with various orders and updates to ensure it handles correctly.
