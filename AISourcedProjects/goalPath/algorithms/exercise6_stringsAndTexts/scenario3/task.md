**Task 1: Implement a function to extract all substrings of a string**

- Enhanced Instruction: Your function should take a string as input and return a list of all possible substrings. This can be done by using two nested loops to generate all possible start and end positions for the substrings. Remember, a substring can be as short as one character and as long as the entire string.
- Potential Input: "abc"
- Desired Output: ["a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"]
- Coach Suggestions: Start by initializing an empty list to store the substrings. Then, use a nested loop where the outer loop starts from the first character and the inner loop traverses from the current character of the outer loop to the end of the string. In each iteration of the inner loop, append the substring to the list.

**Task 2: Implement a function to calculate the frequency of each substring**

- Enhanced Instruction: Your function should take a list of substrings as input and return a dictionary where the keys are the substrings and the values are their respective frequencies. This involves iterating over the list and updating the count of each substring in the dictionary.
- Potential Input: ["a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"]
- Desired Output: {"a": 1, "ab": 1, "abc": 1, "b": 1, "bc": 1, "c": 1}
- Coach Suggestions: Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequencies. Then, iterate over the list of substrings. For each substring, if it is not already a key in the dictionary, add it with a value of 1. If it is already a key, increment its value by 1.

**Task 3: Implement a function to identify the most frequent substring**

- Enhanced Instruction: Your function should take a dictionary of substring frequencies as input and return the substring with the highest frequency. If there are multiple substrings with the same highest frequency, return any one of them.
- Potential Input: {"a": 1, "ab": 1, "abc": 1, "b": 1, "bc": 1, "c": 1}
- Desired Output: "a" (or any other substring since they all have the same frequency)
- Coach Suggestions: Iterate over the dictionary items and keep track of the key-value pair with the highest value. You can do this by initializing two variables, one for the maximum frequency seen so far and one for the corresponding substring. In each iteration, if the current frequency is higher than the maximum frequency seen so far, update these two variables. At the end of the iteration, return the substring with the maximum frequency.
