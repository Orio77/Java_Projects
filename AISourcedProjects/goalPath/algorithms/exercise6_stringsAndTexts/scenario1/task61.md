**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1: Enhancing Natural Language Processing with Advanced String Algorithms
    
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Implement the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient text pattern matching. This involves creating a failure function for the pattern and using it to skip unnecessary comparisons.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the KMP algorithm, focusing on how the failure function is built and used.
            - Implement the KMP algorithm in Java, ensuring to handle edge cases like empty strings and non-matching patterns.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Develop algorithms for identifying and processing palindromes and anagrams in natural language text. This involves checking if a string is the same when read forwards and backwards (for palindromes) and if two strings contain the same characters in any order (for anagrams).
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome. This can be done by comparing the string with its reverse.
            - Implement a function to check if two strings are anagrams. This can be done by sorting the strings and comparing them, or by checking if they have the same character counts.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Create a substring extraction tool for text analysis and summarization. This involves extracting all substrings of a string and processing them for further analysis.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Implement a function to extract all substrings of a string. This can be done by using two nested loops to generate all possible start and end positions for the substrings.
            - Implement a function to process the substrings for text analysis and summarization. This could involve calculating the frequency of each substring, identifying key phrases, etc.
