1. **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:**
    
    - Create a failure array `F[]` of size equal to the length of the pattern `P`. This array will be used to store the length of the proper prefix which is also suffix. `F[i]` will give us the length of the longest proper prefix which is also suffix for the pattern `P[0..i]`.
    - Start comparing characters of the pattern and the text. If a match is found, move to the next character in both. If a mismatch is found, use the failure function to skip comparisons.
2. **Identifying and Processing Palindromes and Anagrams:**
    
    - For palindromes, compare the string with its reverse. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome.
    - For anagrams, compare the sorted versions of two strings. If they are the same, the strings are anagrams.
3. **Substring Extraction Tool:**
    
    - Use two nested loops to generate all possible start and end positions for the substrings of a given string.
    - Process the substrings for text analysis and summarization. This could involve calculating the frequency of each substring, identifying key phrases, etc.
