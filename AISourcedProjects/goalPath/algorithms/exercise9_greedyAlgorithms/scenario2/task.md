- Enhanced task 1 with clear and transparent instruction. Main focus of the task is given by the user topic
    
    - **Task**: Implement a greedy algorithm for lossless data compression, such as Huffman coding. Your goal is to compress data without losing any information.
    - _Potential input_: A string of data. For example: `data = 'hello world'`.
    - _Desired Output_: The compressed data and the Huffman tree. For example: `compressed_data = '0101010101', huffman_tree = {'h': '00', 'e': '01', 'l': '10', 'o': '11', ' ': '010', 'w': '011', 'r': '100', 'd': '101'}`.
    - _Coach Suggestions_: Start by calculating the frequency of each character in the data. Then, use a priority queue to build the Huffman tree. Finally, traverse the Huffman tree to generate the compressed data.
- Enhanced task 2 with clear and transparent instruction. Main focus of the task is given by the user topic
    
    - **Task**: Implement encoding and decoding algorithms to reduce data storage requirements. Your goal is to encode the data in a way that it takes less space, and then decode it to retrieve the original data.
    - _Potential input_: A string of data. For example: `data = 'hello world'`.
    - _Desired Output_: The encoded data and the decoded data. For example: `encoded_data = '0101010101', decoded_data = 'hello world'`.
    - _Coach Suggestions_: You could use a simple encoding scheme such as ASCII or Unicode for this task. To encode the data, convert each character to its corresponding code. To decode the data, convert each code back to its corresponding character.
- Enhanced task 3 with clear and transparent instruction. Main focus of the task is given by the user topic
    
    - **Task**: Explore the trade-offs between local optimization and global efficiency in data compression. Your goal is to understand how making locally optimal choices can affect the overall efficiency of data compression.
    - _Potential input_: A string of data. For example: `data = 'hello world'`.
    - _Desired Output_: A discussion of the trade-offs between local optimization and global efficiency in data compression.
    - _Coach Suggestions_: You could start by implementing a greedy data compression algorithm such as Huffman coding, which makes locally optimal choices. Then, analyze how these choices affect the overall efficiency of the algorithm. Consider factors such as the time complexity, the space complexity, and the compression ratio.
