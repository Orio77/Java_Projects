1. **Implementing a Greedy Algorithm for Task Scheduling:**
    
    - The tasks are sorted based on a certain criteria such as duration or deadline. This could be done using a sorting algorithm.
    - The tasks are then scheduled in the order they appear in the sorted list. The goal is to minimize resource idle time, so tasks with shorter durations or earlier deadlines are scheduled first.
2. **Exploring Local Optima and Global Optima in Task Prioritization:**
    
    - A locally optimal choice is made at each step. This could involve choosing the task with the shortest duration or earliest deadline at each step.
    - The global optimum is found by comparing the results of different locally optimal choices. This could involve using a more advanced algorithm like dynamic programming or simulated annealing to explore different possible combinations of tasks and find the one that results in the minimum total resource idle time.
3. **Addressing Activity Selection Problem Using Greedy Approaches:**
    
    - The activities are sorted based on their end times. This could be done using a sorting algorithm.
    - The activities are then selected in the order they appear in the sorted list, as long as they are compatible with the already selected activities. An activity is compatible if its start time is later than the end time of the last selected activity. The goal is to select a maximum-size set of mutually compatible activities.
