**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1: Optimizing Task Scheduling using Greedy Algorithms
    
- **Refined Sprint Tasks:**
    1. **Task Refinement:** Implement a greedy algorithm to schedule tasks efficiently, with the goal of minimizing resource idle time. This involves sorting tasks based on certain criteria (like duration or deadline) and then scheduling them in that order.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the concept of greedy algorithms, focusing on how they make the locally optimal choice at each step.
            - Implement the greedy algorithm in Python, ensuring to handle edge cases like empty task lists and tasks with the same duration or deadline.
    2. **Task Refinement:** Explore the concepts of local optima and global optima in task prioritization. This involves understanding how a locally optimal choice may or may not lead to a globally optimal solution.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the difference between local optima and global optima, focusing on how greedy algorithms can get stuck in local optima.
            - Implement a function to find the global optimum in task prioritization. This could involve using a more advanced algorithm like dynamic programming or simulated annealing.
    3. **Task Refinement:** Address common scheduling problems like activity selection using greedy approaches. This involves selecting a maximum-size set of mutually compatible activities.
        - **Actionable Instructions:**
            - Understand the activity selection problem, focusing on how it can be solved using a greedy approach.
            - Implement the greedy approach for the activity selection problem in Python, ensuring to handle edge cases like empty activity lists and activities with the same start or end time.
