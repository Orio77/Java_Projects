## Problem Introduction
In our network operations center, we are constantly receiving a stream of network data. This data includes information about network traffic, server load, and potential security threats. To ensure the smooth operation of our network, we need to monitor this data in real-time and quickly identify any anomalies that could indicate a problem.

Handling this stream of data can be challenging due to its volume and complexity. We need a way to process this data efficiently and effectively. This is where the Stream API in Java comes in. The Stream API in Java provides a powerful and flexible way to process data streams, making it an ideal solution for our problem.

Your task is to develop a Stream API application that can process our network data in real-time. The application should be able to filter, map, and reduce the data as needed to identify potential issues. The application should also be able to handle exceptions and null values, and it should be optimized for performance to handle the high volume of data.

## Level 1: Difficulty 5/10
For this task, you will need to create a Stream API application that can process a stream of network data. The data will be represented as a list of NetworkData objects, where each NetworkData object contains information about network traffic, server load, and potential security threats.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Create a Stream<NetworkData> from the list of network data.
2. Use the filter operation to filter out any NetworkData objects that do not meet certain criteria. For example, you might want to filter out any data that does not indicate a potential security threat.
3. Use the map operation to transform the NetworkData objects into a more useful form. For example, you might want to extract the server load from each NetworkData object and create a new Stream<Integer> of server loads.
4. Use the reduce operation to combine the server loads into a single value. For example, you might want to calculate the average server load.
5. Handle any exceptions that might occur during the processing of the stream. For example, you might need to handle NullPointerExceptions if any of the NetworkData objects are null.
6. Optimize the performance of your Stream API application to handle the high volume of data. For example, you might want to use parallel streams to process the data in parallel.

## Level 2: Difficulty 6/10
For this task, you will continue to work on the Stream API application that processes a stream of network data. Now, you will focus on using Stream Collectors to gather the results of your stream operations into a more useful form.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. After filtering and mapping the NetworkData objects as in the previous task, use the collect operation to gather the results into a collection. For example, you might want to collect the server loads into a List<Integer>.
2. Use the Collectors.groupingBy method to group the NetworkData objects by a certain property. For example, you might want to group the data by the type of security threat.
3. Use the Collectors.summingInt method to calculate the total server load for each group.
4. Use the Collectors.toMap method to create a map where the keys are the types of security threats and the values are the total server loads for each type.
5. Handle any exceptions that might occur during the collection process. For example, you might need to handle IllegalStateExceptions if the same key is produced more than once.
6. Optimize the performance of your Stream API application to handle the high volume of data. For example, you might want to use parallel streams to process the data in parallel.

## Level 3: Difficulty 7/10
For this task, you will continue to work on the Stream API application that processes a stream of network data. Now, you will focus on using the Optional class to handle potential null values in your stream.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. After filtering, mapping, and collecting the NetworkData objects as in the previous tasks, use the Optional class to handle potential null values. For example, you might want to use Optional.ofNullable to create an Optional object that may or may not contain a NetworkData object.
2. Use the Optional.isPresent method to check if the Optional object contains a value.
3. Use the Optional.get method to retrieve the value of the Optional object if it is present.
4. Use the Optional.orElse or Optional.orElseGet methods to provide a default value if the Optional object does not contain a value.
5. Use the Optional.map and Optional.flatMap methods to perform operations on the value of the Optional object if it is present.
6. Optimize the performance of your Stream API application to handle the high volume of data. For example, you might want to use parallel streams to process the data in parallel.

## Level 4: Difficulty 8/10
For this task, you will continue to work on the Stream API application that processes a stream of network data. Now, you will focus on implementing error handling strategies to ensure that your application can handle any issues that might arise during the processing of the data.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. After filtering, mapping, collecting, and handling potential null values in the NetworkData objects as in the previous tasks, implement error handling strategies to deal with any exceptions that might occur during the processing of the data.
2. Use the try-catch block to catch any exceptions that might occur during the processing of the stream. For example, you might need to catch NullPointerExceptions if any of the NetworkData objects are null.
3. Use the finally block to ensure that certain actions are performed regardless of whether an exception is thrown. For example, you might want to close any resources that were opened during the processing of the stream.
4. Use the throw statement to throw an exception if a certain condition is met. For example, you might want to throw an exception if the server load exceeds a certain threshold.
5. Use custom exceptions to provide more specific information about the error. For example, you might want to create a HighServerLoadException that is thrown when the server load exceeds a certain threshold.
6. Optimize the performance of your Stream API application to handle the high volume of data. For example, you might want to use parallel streams to process the data in parallel.
