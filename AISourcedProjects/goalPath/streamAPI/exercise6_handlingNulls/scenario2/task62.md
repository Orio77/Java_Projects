**Problem: Advanced Stream API Application**

# Problem Introduction

You are a software developer working on a content management system (CMS) for a news agency. The CMS has a feature that automatically tags articles based on their content. However, you've noticed that the system sometimes encounters null values when processing streams of article data, causing the tagging process to fail.

Your task is to handle these null values in the Stream API operations to ensure the tagging process runs smoothly. This will involve filtering out null values, handling potential exceptions, and ensuring that the stream operations perform optimally.

**Level 1: Difficulty 5/10**

Your first task is to ensure that the Stream API operations can handle null values in the stream of article data.

You are given a `Stream<Article>` where `Article` is a class with properties `title`, `content`, and `tags`. The `tags` property is a `List<String>` that can sometimes be null.

Your task is to write a method `processArticles(Stream<Article> articles)` that does the following:

1. Filters out any articles where either the title or content is null.
2. For each remaining article, if the tags list is null, initialize it to an empty list.
3. Returns a list of all processed articles.

Remember to ensure that your stream operations are efficient. You should not perform any unnecessary operations and should take advantage of short-circuiting where possible.

Here is the `Article` class for reference:

public class Article {

    private String title;

    private String content;

    private List<String> tags;

    // getters and setters omitted for brevity

}

Note: This task involves basic to intermediate Stream API operations such as `filter`, `map`, and `collect`. It introduces the core concept of handling null values in Stream API operations.

**Level 2: Difficulty 6/10**

Drawn Topic: Stream Performance

Your next task is to optimize the performance of the Stream API operations in the tagging process.

You've noticed that the `processArticles(Stream<Article> articles)` method you wrote in the previous task can be slow when processing large streams of articles. This is because it processes the articles sequentially.

Your task is to modify the `processArticles` method to process the articles in parallel. This will involve converting the stream to a parallel stream and ensuring that the operations are thread-safe.

Remember that not all operations benefit from parallelization, and it can even be detrimental if not used correctly. You should only parallelize operations that are computationally intensive and can be broken down into independent tasks.

**Level 3: Difficulty 7/10**

Your next task is to handle potential exceptions that might occur during the tagging process.

You've noticed that the `processArticles(Stream<Article> articles)` method you wrote in the previous tasks can throw an exception when processing the articles. This is because some operations on the articles, such as accessing the tags, can throw an exception if the article is in an invalid state.

Your task is to modify the `processArticles` method to handle these exceptions gracefully. This will involve using the `try-catch` construct to catch any exceptions that occur during the stream operations and logging them for debugging purposes.

Remember that exception handling is a crucial part of writing robust and fault-tolerant code. You should aim to handle exceptions in a way that allows the program to continue running and provides useful information about the error.

**Level 4: Difficulty 8/10**

Your next task is to enhance the tagging process by integrating it with a data structure.

You've noticed that the `processArticles(Stream<Article> articles)` method you wrote in the previous tasks only processes the articles but does not store them for future reference. This is inefficient as the same articles might need to be processed again in the future.

Your task is to modify the `processArticles` method to store the processed articles in a data structure. This will involve using a suitable data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

Remember that the choice of data structure can significantly impact the performance of your code. You should choose a data structure that is well-suited to the specific requirements of your application.
