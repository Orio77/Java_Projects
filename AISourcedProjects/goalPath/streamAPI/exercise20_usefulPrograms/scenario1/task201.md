**Problem: Advanced Stream API Application**

# Problem Introduction

You are a software developer at a large retail company. The company has a vast amount of data about products, sales, and customers. The management team wants to gain insights from this data to make informed business decisions. They have asked you to develop a solution using Java's Stream API to process and analyze this data efficiently.

Your task is to create a series of applications that use the Stream API to filter, map, and reduce the data. You will need to handle null values, use lambda expressions, and implement various stream operations. You will also need to ensure your code is efficient and handles exceptions properly. This will be a challenging task, but it will give you a deep understanding of the Stream API and its practical applications.

**Level 1: Difficulty 5/10**

Your first task is to create a Java application that uses the Stream API to filter and analyze the company's product data. The product data is represented as a list of Product objects, where each Product has a name, category, price, and salesCount.

Here are your specific tasks:

Filter out all the products that have a salesCount of less than 100. These products are not popular and should not be included in the analysis.

Use the map operation to transform the stream of Product objects into a stream of price values. We are interested in the prices of the products for the next steps.

Use the reduce operation to find the sum of all the product prices. This will give us an idea of the total revenue generated by these products.

Handle any potential null values in the Product list. If a null value is encountered, it should be ignored and not cause the application to crash.

Use lambda expressions wherevever possible to make your code more concise and readable.

**Level 2: Difficulty 6/10**

The topic drawn from the list is "Stream Collectors".

Your second task is to create a Java application that uses the Stream API and Stream Collectors to group the company's product data by category. The product data is represented as a list of Product objects, where each Product has a name, category, price, and salesCount.

Here are your specific tasks:

1. Filter out all the products that have a salesCount of less than 100. These products are not popular and should not be included in the analysis.
    
2. Use the `Collectors.groupingBy` function to group the products by their category. This will result in a `Map<String, List<Product>>` where the key is the category and the value is a list of products in that category.
    
3. For each category, use the `Collectors.summingInt` function to find the total salesCount. This will give us an idea of the popularity of each category.
    
4. Handle any potential null values in the Product list. If a null value is encountered, it should be ignored and not cause the application to crash.
    
5. Use lambda expressions wherever possible to make your code more concise and readable.

**Level 3: Difficulty 7/10**

Your third task is to create a Java application that uses the Stream API and Parallel Streams to analyze the company's product data. The product data is represented as a list of Product objects, where each Product has a name, category, price, and salesCount.

Here are your specific tasks:

1. Filter out all the products that have a salesCount of less than 100. These products are not popular and should not be included in the analysis.
    
2. Convert your stream to a parallel stream using the `parallel()` method. This will allow the operations to be performed in parallel, which can significantly improve performance for large datasets.
    
3. Use the `Collectors.groupingByConcurrent()` function to group the products by their category. This will result in a `ConcurrentMap<String, List<Product>>` where the key is the category and the value is a list of products in that category.
    
4. For each category, use the `Collectors.summingInt` function to find the total salesCount. This will give us an idea of the popularity of each category.
    
5. Handle any potential null values in the Product list. If a null value is encountered, it should be ignored and not cause the application to crash.
    
6. Use lambda expressions wherever possible to make your code more concise and readable.

**Level 4: Difficulty 8/10**

Your fourth task is to create a Java application that uses the Stream API to analyze the company's product data, with a focus on robust exception handling. The product data is represented as a list of Product objects, where each Product has a name, category, price, and salesCount.

Here are your specific tasks:

1. Filter out all the products that have a salesCount of less than 100. These products are not popular and should not be included in the analysis.
    
2. Use the `Collectors.groupingBy` function to group the products by their category. This will result in a `Map<String, List<Product>>` where the key is the category and the value is a list of products in that category.
    
3. For each category, use the `Collectors.summingInt` function to find the total salesCount. This will give us an idea of the popularity of each category.
    
4. Handle any potential null values in the Product list. If a null value is encountered, it should be ignored and not cause the application to crash.
    
5. Implement robust exception handling. If an exception occurs during the stream operations (for example, a `NumberFormatException` when parsing the salesCount), the exception should be logged and the specific product causing the exception should be skipped, allowing the rest of the stream operations to continue.
    
6. Use lambda expressions wherever possible to make your code more concise and readable.
    
7. Test your application thoroughly to ensure that it can handle a variety of edge cases and unexpected inputs without crashing.
