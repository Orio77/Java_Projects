## Problem: Advanced Stream API Application

### Problem Introduction

The finance department of a large corporation has thousands of transaction records scattered across multiple databases. These records need to be consolidated and ordered for auditing purposes. The task is to use the Stream API in Java to handle this problem. The Stream API provides a high-level, declarative approach to working with data, allowing for efficient processing of large data sets. The corporation's IT team has decided to use this API to streamline the process of consolidating and ordering the transaction records.

### Level 1: Difficulty 5/10

For this task, you are required to consolidate the transaction records from multiple databases into a single list. Each transaction record is an object with properties such as transactionId, amount, date, and departmentId.

The first step is to use the Stream API to create a stream of transaction records from each database. Then, you need to use the flatMap operation to consolidate these streams into a single stream.

Once you have a single stream of transaction records, use the sorted operation to order the records by date. Remember that the sorted operation requires a Comparator, so you will need to use a lambda expression to define how the sorting should be done.

Finally, use the collect operation to convert the stream back into a list. This list should contain all the transaction records, consolidated from all databases and ordered by date.

This task introduces the core concept of stream ordering and also incorporates other basic to intermediate Stream API operations such as flatMap, sorted, and collect.

Please write a Java function that implements this task. The function should take a list of databases as input and return a list of transaction records as output.

### Level 2: Difficulty 6/10

First, you need to modify the stream operations to handle potential exceptions. When creating the stream of transaction records from each database, use the try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur. If an exception occurs, log the error and continue with the next record.

Next, when sorting the records, it's possible that some records may not have a date. This would cause an exception when trying to compare them. To handle this, modify the lambda expression used for sorting to check if the date is null before comparing. If the date is null, consider the record to be greater than any other record. This will effectively place all records with null dates at the end of the sorted list.

Finally, when collecting the records into a list, again use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur. If an exception occurs, log the error and continue with the next record.

Please write a Java function that implements this task. The function should take a list of databases as input and return a list of transaction records as output. The function should also log any errors that occur during processing.

### Level 3: Difficulty 7/10

First, modify the stream creation to create a parallel stream instead of a sequential stream. This can be done by calling the parallelStream method instead of the stream method.

Next, modify the sorted operation to use a parallel sort. This can be done by first collecting the stream into an array, then using the Arrays.parallelSort method to sort the array. After sorting, convert the array back into a stream.

Finally, when collecting the records into a list, use the toConcurrentList collector instead of the toList collector. This collector is designed for use with parallel streams and can improve performance by reducing contention on the list.

Please write a Java function that implements this task. The function should take a list of databases as input and return a list of transaction records as output. The function should also log any errors that occur during processing.

### Level 4: Difficulty 8/10

First, modify the stream creation to retry the operation if an exception occurs. This can be done by using a loop that attempts to create the stream a certain number of times before logging the error and continuing with the next database.

Next, modify the sorted operation to retry the operation if an exception occurs. This can be done by using a try-catch block inside the lambda expression used for sorting. If an exception occurs, retry the comparison a certain number of times before considering the record to be greater than any other record.

Finally, modify the collect operation to retry the operation if an exception occurs. This can be done by using a try-catch block inside the collector. If an exception occurs, retry the collection a certain number of times before logging the error and continuing with the next record.

Please write a Java function that implements this task. The function should take a list of databases as input and return a list of transaction records as output. The function should also log any errors that occur during processing.
