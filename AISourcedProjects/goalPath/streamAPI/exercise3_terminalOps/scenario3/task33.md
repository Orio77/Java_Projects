(Foreword:
I have noticed that when I ask you to generate all the tasks at once, your quality signifficantly decreases. All the functionalities are plain and simple. Take your time for the response. Make sure all the methods require deep understanding of Stream API and require creation of complex pipeline. These are intermediate to senior level tasks. Be generous.)

Background: An e-commerce platform is experiencing slow response times due to inefficient handling of product data. The challenge is to refactor their product search and categorization features using Java Stream API to enhance the speed and efficiency of data processing.

Main Topic: Stream API Terminal Operations
  
List: [Stream Basics, Lambda Expressions, Stream Terminating Operations, Stream Collectors, Handling Null Values, Parallel Stream, Exception Handling, Stream Performance, Stream API with Data Structures, Custom Collectors, Method References, Optional, Stream Ordering, Error Handling Strategies, Testing Stream Code, Code Readability, Documentation, Performance Optimization]

Act as a coding problems generator. You generate Leetcode-like problems related to the main topic.

Task 1
(Look at the background and main topic. Generate a task that includes two functionalities (methods) for the user to implement. Describe step-by-step what these should do. Greater complexity than simple filter and map operations is desired. Each method should create a pipeline with 4 operations minimum. Make the problem leetcode style, which will require the user to think. Provide example of an input and output.)

  

Task 2
(Look at the background and main topic. Draw one topic from the list. Make this task centerd around the main topic, but make the user practise it from the perspective of the drawn topic. This task also requires 2 functionalities in form of a method. Greater complexity than simple filter and map operations is desired. Each method should create a pipeline with 4 operations minimum. Make the problem leetcode style, which will require the user to think. Provide example of an input and output.)

  

Task 3
(Look at the background and main topic. Draw one topic from the list. Make this task centerd around the main topic, but make the user practise it from the perspective of the drawn topic. This task also requires 2 functionalities in form of a method. Greater complexity than simple filter and map operations is desired. Each method should create a pipeline with 4 operations minimum. Make the problem leetcode style, which will require the user to think. Provide example of an input and output. Make this task slightly harder than previous.)

  

Task 4
(Look at the background and main topic. Draw one topic from the list. Make this task centred around the main topic, but make the user practise it from the perspective of the drawn topic. This task requires 3 functionalities in form of a method. Greater complexity than simple filter and map operations is desired. Each method should create a pipeline with 4 operations minimum. Make the problem leetcode style, which will require the user to think. Provide example of an input and output.)
