Background: An IT team needs to process large log files to identify unique error messages for a particular day.

Main Topic: Stream Performence

**Problem: Advanced Stream API Application**

# Problem Introduction

(In a large IT company, the team is responsible for maintaining the health of several applications. These applications generate large log files daily, which contain information about the application's activities, including any errors that occurred. The team needs to process these log files to identify unique error messages for a particular day. This is a crucial task as it helps the team to identify any new issues that have arisen and to prioritize their work based on the frequency and severity of the errors.

The team has decided to use the Stream API in Java to process these log files. The Stream API provides a powerful and flexible framework for processing sequences of data elements, making it an ideal choice for this task. The team will need to use various operations provided by the Stream API, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, to extract the necessary information from the log files.

The team's goal is to develop a series of applications using the Stream API that can process the log files and identify unique error messages for a particular day. The applications should be able to handle large log files efficiently and provide accurate results. The team will start with basic applications and gradually increase the complexity as they become more familiar with the Stream API.)

**Level 1: Difficulty 5/10**

(In this task, you are required to develop a Java application that uses the Stream API to process a log file. The log file is a text file where each line represents a log entry. Each log entry is formatted as follows:

For example:

Your task is to process this log file and identify all unique error messages for a particular day. You should use the Stream API's filter operation to filter out log entries that are not from the specified day and are not error messages. Then, use the map operation to extract the error message from each log entry. Finally, use the distinct operation to identify unique error messages.

Here are the specific requirements for this task:

Read the log file line by line and create a Stream of log entries.
Use the filter operation to keep only the log entries that are from the specified day and are error messages.
Use the map operation to extract the error message from each log entry.
Use the distinct operation to identify unique error messages.
Print out each unique error message.
You can assume that the log file is correctly formatted and that the timestamp of each log entry is in the format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss. You can also assume that the error level is always one of the following: INFO, WARNING, ERROR.

This task will help you get familiar with the basic operations of the Stream API and how to use them to process data.)

**Level 2: Difficulty 6/10**

(For this task, you will build upon the application developed in Level 1. Now, instead of just identifying unique error messages for a particular day, you are required to categorize these error messages based on their severity level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

The log file format remains the same as in Level 1. Your task is to process this log file, identify all unique error messages for a particular day, and categorize them based on their severity level.

Here are the specific requirements for this task:

Read the log file line by line and create a Stream of log entries.
Use the filter operation to keep only the log entries that are from the specified day and are error messages.
Use the map operation to extract the error message and its severity level from each log entry.
Use the groupBy operation to categorize the error messages based on their severity level.
For each severity level, use the distinct operation to identify unique error messages.
Print out each unique error message, grouped by its severity level.
This task will help you get familiar with the groupBy operation of the Stream API and how to use it to categorize data.)

**Level 3: Difficulty 7/10**

(For this task, you will build upon the application developed in Level 2. Now, you are required to not only categorize the error messages based on their severity level, but also count the number of occurrences of each unique error message for a particular day.

The log file format remains the same as in Level 1 and 2. Your task is to process this log file, identify all unique error messages for a particular day, categorize them based on their severity level, and count the number of occurrences of each unique error message.

Here are the specific requirements for this task:

Read the log file line by line and create a Stream of log entries.
Use the filter operation to keep only the log entries that are from the specified day and are error messages.
Use the map operation to extract the error message and its severity level from each log entry.
Use the groupBy operation to categorize the error messages based on their severity level.
For each severity level, use the groupingBy operation again to count the number of occurrences of each unique error message.
Print out each unique error message, its severity level, and its count.
This task will help you get familiar with nested operations of the Stream API, complex filtering, and data transformations.)

**Level 4: Difficulty 8/10**

(For this task, you will build upon the application developed in Level 3. Now, you are required to handle multiple log files from different applications and merge their data for analysis. The log files from different applications may have different formats, and you need to handle these variations.

The log file format remains the same as in Level 1, 2, and 3 for some applications, but for others, it might be slightly different. Your task is to process these log files, identify all unique error messages for a particular day from all applications, categorize them based on their severity level, and count the number of occurrences of each unique error message.

Here are the specific requirements for this task:

Read multiple log files line by line and create a Stream of log entries.
Use the filter operation to keep only the log entries that are from the specified day and are error messages.
Use the map operation to extract the error message and its severity level from each log entry.
Handle variations in log file formats. For example, some log files might have a different timestamp format or a different order of fields.
Use the groupBy operation to categorize the error messages based on their severity level.
For each severity level, use the groupingBy operation again to count the number of occurrences of each unique error message.
Print out each unique error message, its severity level, and its count, from all applications.
This task will help you get familiar with handling multiple data sources, dealing with variations in data formats, and merging data using the Stream API.)

**Level 5: Difficulty 9/10**

(For this task, you will build upon the application developed in Level 4. Now, you are required to handle multiple log files from different applications, merge their data for analysis, and provide a summary report of the error messages. The report should include the total number of unique error messages, the most frequent error message for each severity level, and the application that generated the most errors for a particular day.

The log file format remains the same as in Level 1, 2, 3, and 4 for some applications, but for others, it might be slightly different. Your task is to process these log files, identify all unique error messages for a particular day from all applications, categorize them based on their severity level, count the number of occurrences of each unique error message, and generate a summary report.

Here are the specific requirements for this task:

Read multiple log files line by line and create a Stream of log entries.
Use the filter operation to keep only the log entries that are from the specified day and are error messages.
Use the map operation to extract the error message, its severity level, and the application name from each log entry.
Handle variations in log file formats. For example, some log files might have a different timestamp format or a different order of fields.
Use the groupBy operation to categorize the error messages based on their severity level.
For each severity level, use the groupingBy operation again to count the number of occurrences of each unique error message.
Identify the most frequent error message for each severity level.
Identify the application that generated the most errors.
Print out a summary report that includes the total number of unique error messages, the most frequent error message for each severity level, and the application that generated the most errors.
This task will help you get familiar with advanced operations of the Stream API, complex data analysis, and generating summary reports based on the processed data.)
