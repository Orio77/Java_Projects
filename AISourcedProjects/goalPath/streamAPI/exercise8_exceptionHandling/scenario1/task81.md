Background: A sales team has a list of sales transactions and needs to calculate the total sales amount for the month.

Main Topic: Exception Handling

**Problem: Advanced Stream API Application**

# Problem Introduction

(The sales team at XYZ Corporation has a list of sales transactions for the month. Each transaction includes details such as the salesperson's name, the product sold, the quantity sold, and the price per unit. The team needs to calculate the total sales amount for the month to track their performance and identify top performers.

However, the data is not always clean. Sometimes, transactions are recorded with missing or incorrect details. For example, a transaction might be missing the price per unit, or the quantity sold might be recorded as a negative number. These errors can cause calculations to fail or produce incorrect results.

To handle these issues, the team decides to use Java's Stream API. The Stream API allows them to process the data in a declarative way, which is more readable and easier to debug than traditional imperative code. It also provides powerful features for handling errors and exceptions, which are crucial for dealing with the messy real-world data.

In this exercise, you will help the sales team by writing a series of Java programs that use the Stream API to process the sales data. You will start with simple tasks, such as calculating the total sales amount, and gradually move on to more complex tasks, such as identifying the top-selling products and handling transactions with missing or incorrect details. Through these tasks, you will learn how to use the Stream API effectively and how to handle exceptions in a robust and elegant way.)

**Level 1: Difficulty 5/10**

(In this level, you will write a Java program that calculates the total sales amount for the month. You will use the Stream API to process the list of sales transactions.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

Create a Sale class with the following fields: salespersonName, product, quantity, and pricePerUnit. Each field should have appropriate getters and setters.

Create a list of Sale objects. For now, you can hardcode the data in your program.

Use the stream() method to convert the list into a stream.

Use the mapToDouble() method to transform each Sale object into a double value representing the total amount of the sale (i.e., quantity multiplied by pricePerUnit).

Use the sum() method to calculate the total sales amount.

Print the total sales amount.

Remember to handle any potential exceptions that might occur, such as null values or incorrect data types. You can use the filter() method to exclude any transactions with missing or incorrect details from the calculation.)

**Level 2: Difficulty 6/10**

(In this level, you will enhance the Java program by identifying the top-selling products. You will use the Stream API to process the list of sales transactions and sort them based on the total sales amount for each product.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

Use the stream() method to convert the list of sales transactions into a stream.

Use the collect() method with Collectors.groupingBy() to group the sales transactions by product.

For each group, use the Collectors.summingDouble() collector to calculate the total sales amount for each product (i.e., sum of quantity multiplied by pricePerUnit for each product).

This will give you a Map where the keys are the products and the values are the total sales amounts.

Convert this Map into a Stream and sort it in descending order based on the sales amounts.

Use the limit() method to get the top-selling products.

Print the top-selling products along with their total sales amounts.

Remember to handle any potential exceptions that might occur, such as null values or incorrect data types. You can use the filter() method to exclude any transactions with missing or incorrect details from the calculation.)

**Level 3: Difficulty 7/10**

(In this level, you will extend the Java program by calculating the total sales amount for each salesperson. You will use the Stream API to process the list of sales transactions and group them by salesperson.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

Use the stream() method to convert the list of sales transactions into a stream.

Use the collect() method with Collectors.groupingBy() to group the sales transactions by salesperson.

For each group, use the Collectors.summingDouble() collector to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson (i.e., sum of quantity multiplied by pricePerUnit for each salesperson's sales).

This will give you a Map where the keys are the salespersons and the values are their total sales amounts.

Convert this Map into a Stream and sort it in descending order based on the sales amounts.

Print the salespersons along with their total sales amounts.

Remember to handle any potential exceptions that might occur, such as null values or incorrect data types. You can use the filter() method to exclude any transactions with missing or incorrect details from the calculation.)

**Level 4: Difficulty 8/10**

(In this level, you will enhance the Java program by merging sales data from multiple sources and handling large datasets. You will use the Stream API to process the list of sales transactions, merge them, and calculate the total sales amount for each product from all sources.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

Create multiple lists of Sale objects, each representing a different data source. For now, you can hardcode the data in your program.

Use the Stream.concat() method to merge the streams from all data sources into a single stream.

Use the collect() method with Collectors.groupingBy() to group the sales transactions by product.

For each group, use the Collectors.summingDouble() collector to calculate the total sales amount for each product (i.e., sum of quantity multiplied by pricePerUnit for each product from all sources).

This will give you a Map where the keys are the products and the values are the total sales amounts from all sources.

Convert this Map into a Stream and sort it in descending order based on the sales amounts.

Print the products along with their total sales amounts from all sources.

Remember to handle any potential exceptions that might occur, such as null values or incorrect data types. You can use the filter() method to exclude any transactions with missing or incorrect details from the calculation. Also, consider the performance implications of handling large datasets and try to optimize your code accordingly.)

**Level 5: Difficulty 9/10**

(In this level, you will integrate all the skills you've learned so far to create a comprehensive Java program that handles complex scenarios, sophisticated data analysis, and intricate Stream API operations. You will process the list of sales transactions, handle exceptions, identify top performers, and provide insights into sales trends.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

Use the Stream API to process the list of sales transactions from multiple data sources. Merge these sources using the Stream.concat() method.

Handle any potential exceptions that might occur, such as null values or incorrect data types. You can use the filter() method to exclude any transactions with missing or incorrect details from the calculation.

Use the collect() method with Collectors.groupingBy() to group the sales transactions by salesperson. For each group, use the Collectors.summingDouble() collector to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson (i.e., sum of quantity multiplied by pricePerUnit for each salesperson's sales).

Identify the top performers by sorting the salespersons in descending order based on their total sales amounts. Use the limit() method to get the top salespersons.

Similarly, group the sales transactions by product and calculate the total sales amount for each product. Identify the top-selling products.

Analyze sales trends by grouping the sales transactions by month (you will need to add a date field to your Sale class for this). Calculate the total sales amount for each month and identify any trends, such as peak sales months.

Print the top salespersons, top-selling products, and sales trends.

Remember to consider the performance implications of handling large datasets and try to optimize your code accordingly. You can use parallel streams, if appropriate, to speed up the processing.)

This final challenge synthesizes all the aspects of the main topic and background into a final, intricate application of the Stream API. It requires you to employ all the skills and knowledge acquired in previous levels, and it will give you a deep understanding of how to use the Stream API effectively in real-world scenarios.
