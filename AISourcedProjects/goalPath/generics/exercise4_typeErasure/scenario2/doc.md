# Documentation for the Data Serialization Library Exercise

## Classes to Create

1. `DataSerializer<T>`: This class will represent a generic data serializer with a type parameter `T`.

## Class Methods

### DataSerializer

1. `serializeData`: This method will serialize data of type `T`. It ensures flexibility by allowing for the serialization of data of any type.
    
2. `deserializeData`: This method will deserialize data of type `T`. It ensures flexibility by allowing for the deserialization of data of any type.
    
3. `serialize`: This method will serialize data, ensuring it adheres to the `T` type. It demonstrates how to maintain type safety during serialization.
    
4. `deserialize`: This method will deserialize data, ensuring it adheres to the `T` type. It demonstrates how to maintain type safety during deserialization.
    
5. `checkTypeAtRuntime`: This method will check the type of data at runtime. It showcases how runtime type checks can be used to mitigate the effects of type erasure.
    
6. `annotateType`: This method will annotate the type of data to preserve it during serialization and deserialization. It demonstrates how annotations can be used to mitigate the effects of type erasure.
    

## General Overview

The `DataSerializer<T>` class is responsible for serializing and deserializing data of any type `T`. It ensures type safety during these operations and mitigates the effects of type erasure by checking the type of data at runtime and annotating the type of data.

## Example Workflow

1. A `DataSerializer<T>` object is created. This could represent a serializer for any type `T`.
    
2. The `serializeData` method of the `DataSerializer<T>` object is called. This serializes data of type `T`.
    
3. The `deserializeData` method of the `DataSerializer<T>` object is called. This deserializes data of type `T`.
    
4. The `serialize` and `deserialize` methods of the `DataSerializer<T>` object are called. These ensure type safety during serialization and deserialization.
    
5. The `checkTypeAtRuntime` method of the `DataSerializer<T>` object is called. This checks the type of data at runtime.
    
6. The `annotateType` method of the `DataSerializer<T>` object is called. This annotates the type of data to preserve it during serialization and deserialization.
