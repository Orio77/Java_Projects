## Example Workflow

1. A `Message<?>` object is created. This could represent a message with any type of attachment.
    
2. The `attachFile` method of the `Message<?>` object is called. This attaches a file of any type to the message.
    
3. The `displayAttachment`, `downloadAttachment`, and `processAttachment` methods of the `Message<?>` object are called. These display, download, and process the attachment, respectively, regardless of its type.
    
4. An `AttachmentProcessor<?>` object is created. This could represent a processor for any type of attachment.
    
5. The `process` method of the `AttachmentProcessor<?>` object is called. This processes any type of attachment.
