**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 2: Develop a chat application using Java Generics with wildcard types to manage message attachments that can be images, documents, or other file types.

1. **Create a Messaging System with Wildcard Attachments:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - Define a generic class `Message<?>` with a wildcard type to hold various attachment types.
        - A method `attachFile` to attach files of any type to the message.
    - **Description:**
        - The `attachFile` method allows for attaching files of any type to the message, ensuring flexibility.
2. **Develop Methods for Handling Different Attachment Types:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - `displayAttachment`: A method to display the attachment, regardless of its type.
        - `downloadAttachment`: A method to download the attachment, regardless of its type.
        - `processAttachment`: A method to process the attachment, regardless of its type.
    - **Description:**
        - The `displayAttachment`, `downloadAttachment`, and `processAttachment` methods demonstrate how wildcard types can be used to handle a wide range of attachment types, reinforcing the concept of type safety in operations.
3. **Ensure Wide Range of Attachment Formats:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - `AttachmentProcessor<?>`: A class that uses wildcard type to work with any type of attachment.
        - `process`: A method to process any type of attachment.
    - **Description:**
        - The `AttachmentProcessor` class demonstrates how to use a wildcard type to handle any type of attachment, ensuring flexibility.
        - The `process` method illustrates practical use of wildcard types, reinforcing the concept of type safety in operations.
