**Sprint Tasks:**

1. **Analyze the Application for Potential Performance Bottlenecks Related to Generics:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - Use profiling tools to identify areas in the code where excessive boxing and unboxing operations are performed due to generics.
        - Identify areas where unnecessary object creation due to generics is causing memory overhead.
    - **Description:**
        - Profiling tools can help identify performance bottlenecks related to generics, such as excessive boxing and unboxing operations and unnecessary object creation, which can lead to memory overhead and slower execution.
2. **Refactor the Code to Reduce Unnecessary Memory Allocations and Type Conversions:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - Refactor the code to use primitive types instead of boxed types where possible to reduce boxing and unboxing operations.
        - Avoid unnecessary object creation by reusing objects where possible.
    - **Description:**
        - Using primitive types instead of boxed types can reduce boxing and unboxing operations, improving execution speed.
        - Reusing objects instead of creating new ones can reduce memory overhead, improving performance.
3. **Implement Caching and Memory Management Strategies to Enhance Overall Performance:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - Implement a cache for frequently accessed data to reduce expensive database or network operations.
        - Use a memory-efficient data structure for storing large datasets.
    - **Description:**
        - Implementing a cache can reduce expensive database or network operations, improving performance.
        - Using a memory-efficient data structure can reduce memory overhead when storing large datasets, improving performance.




- **Refined Scenario:** Scenario 7: Enhance a software's input handling using Java Generics for versatility and type safety.
    
    1. **Implement a Generic Class for Diverse Input Types:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - Define a generic class `GenericInputHolder` with a type parameter `T` to hold various input types.
        - A method to add input of type `T` to the class.
        - Method to retrieve input based on an index.
    - **Description:**
        - The `add` method allows for adding inputs of any type, ensuring flexibility.
        - The `get` method enables retrieval of input, demonstrating how generics can manage different input types with type safety.

2. **Use Bounded Type Parameters for Input Validation:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - `InputValidator`: A class that uses bounded type parameters to work only with subclasses of `Input`.
        - `validate`: A method to validate input, ensuring it adheres to the `Input` type.
    - **Description:**
        - The `InputValidator` class demonstrates how to restrict a generic type to a certain range of subclasses, ensuring type safety.
        - The `validate` method illustrates practical use of bounded generics, reinforcing the concept of type safety in operations.
3. **Develop a Generic Input Processing Algorithm:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - `processGenericInput:` A static method to process an input containing any type that implements `Processable`.
        - `demonstrateProcessing`: A method to demonstrate processing with different input types.
    - **Description:**
        - The `processGenericInput` method showcases how a single method can be used to process inputs of any processable type, illustrating the power of generics.
        - The `demonstrateProcessing` method is for testing and showing the effectiveness of the generic process across different input types, emphasizing the versatility of Java Generics.
