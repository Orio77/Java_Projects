**Task: Implementing Generics in Mathematical Utility Library**

Building upon the initial task of creating a Mathematical Utility Library, your new task is to integrate the concept of Generics into the Matrix and Statistics classes.

**Generic Matrix Class**

The Matrix class should be able to handle not only integers but also any numeric type (like float, double, etc.) using Generics. The operations to be performed remain the same:

1. `Matrix Addition`: Implement a method `add` that takes another Matrix object and returns a new Matrix object that is the result of the addition of the two matrices. If the matrices are not of the same dimensions, throw an appropriate exception.
    
2. `Matrix Multiplication`: Implement a method `multiply` that takes another Matrix object and returns a new Matrix object that is the result of the multiplication of the two matrices. If the matrices are not compatible for multiplication, throw an appropriate exception.
    

**Generic Statistics Class**

The Statistics class should also be made generic to handle any numeric type. The operations to be performed are:

1. `Mean Calculation`: Implement a method `calculateMean` that returns the mean of the list of numbers.
    
2. `Standard Deviation Calculation`: Implement a method `calculateStandardDeviation` that returns the standard deviation of the list of numbers.
    

**Documentation**

In addition to implementing these classes and methods, update the documentation to explain how the library handles Generics. The documentation should include:

1. A brief explanation of how Generics are used in each class and its methods.
2. The benefits and considerations of using Generics in this context.
3. Examples of how to use each method with different numeric types.

**Constraints**

- The Matrix class should be able to handle and throw exceptions appropriately when operations cannot be performed due to dimension mismatches.
- The Statistics class should be able to handle and throw exceptions appropriately when operations cannot be performed due to an empty list.
- The dimensions of the matrices and the size of the list do not exceed 100x100 and 10^5 respectively.
- The dimensions of the matrices and the size of the list are at least 1x1 and 1 respectively.

**Learning Objective**

By the end of this task, you should have a practical understanding of how to use Generics in Java, specifically in the context of a mathematical utility library. You should also understand the benefits and considerations of using Generics, and how to document their use effectively.

**Task: Implementing Generic Interfaces and Enhancing Error Handling**

Building upon the previous tasks of creating a Mathematical Utility Library with Generics, your new task is to integrate the concept of Generic Interfaces and enhance error handling in the Matrix and Statistics classes.

**Generic Interface**

Create a Generic Interface `MathOperations<T>` where `T` is a numeric type. This interface should declare the following methods:

1. `T add(T other)`: Takes another object of type `T` and returns a new object that is the result of the addition of the two objects.
    
2. `T multiply(T other)`: Takes another object of type `T` and returns a new object that is the result of the multiplication of the two objects.
    

**Enhanced Matrix Class**

The Matrix class should implement the `MathOperations<Matrix<T>>` interface. The operations to be performed remain the same, but now they should be implemented as part of the interface. Also, enhance the error handling to provide more detailed messages when operations cannot be performed due to dimension mismatches.

**Enhanced Statistics Class**

The Statistics class should implement the `MathOperations<List<T>>` interface. The operations to be performed are:

1. `T calculateMean()`: Returns the mean of the list of numbers.
    
2. `T calculateStandardDeviation()`: Returns the standard deviation of the list of numbers.
    

Enhance the error handling to provide more detailed messages when operations cannot be performed due to an empty list.

**Documentation**

In addition to implementing these classes and methods, update the documentation to explain how the library handles Generic Interfaces and enhanced error handling. The documentation should include:

1. A brief explanation of how Generic Interfaces are used in each class and its methods.
2. The benefits and considerations of using Generic Interfaces in this context.
3. Examples of how to use each method with different numeric types.
4. A detailed explanation of the error handling enhancements and how they improve the usability of the library.

**Constraints**

- The Matrix class should be able to handle and throw exceptions appropriately when operations cannot be performed due to dimension mismatches.
- The Statistics class should be able to handle and throw exceptions appropriately when operations cannot be performed due to an empty list.
- The dimensions of the matrices and the size of the list do not exceed 100x100 and 10^5 respectively.
- The dimensions of the matrices and the size of the list are at least 1x1 and 1 respectively.

**Learning Objective**

By the end of this task, you should have a practical understanding of how to use Generic Interfaces in Java, specifically in the context of a mathematical utility library. You should also understand the benefits and considerations of using Generic Interfaces, how to handle errors effectively, and how to document their use effectively.
