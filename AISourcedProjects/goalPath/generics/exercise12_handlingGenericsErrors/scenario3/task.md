**Topic: Generics in Collections and Handling Generics Errors**

**Problem: Scientific Simulation Error Handling with Generics**

You are part of a team building a scientific simulation platform. Your task is to create robust error-handling procedures to manage potential generic errors that may arise when modeling various scientific phenomena. In addition, you are required to integrate the use of generics in collections as part of the simulation parameters.

Your task is divided into three parts:

1. **Error Handling Class**: Create a class named `SimulationError` that will be used to handle errors in the simulation. This class should have the following methods:
    
    - `logError(error: Error)`: This method should take an error object as an argument and log it in a way that is useful for debugging. This could include logging the error message, the stack trace, and any other relevant information.
        
    - `notifyUser(error: Error)`: This method should take an error object as an argument and notify the user of the error in a user-friendly way. This could include displaying a user-friendly error message, or providing suggestions for how to resolve the error.
        
2. **Simulation Class**: Create a class named `ScientificSimulation` that will be used to run the scientific simulations. This class should have the following methods:
    
    - `runSimulation(parameters: Map<String, Object>)`: This method should take a Map of parameters as an argument and run the simulation. If any errors occur during the simulation, it should catch them and use the `SimulationError` class to handle them.
        
    - `validateParameters(parameters: Map<String, Object>)`: This method should take a Map of parameters as an argument and validate them. If the parameters are not valid, it should throw an error.
        
3. **Generics in Collections**: The parameters for the simulation should be passed as a Map with String keys and values of a generic type. The `validateParameters` method should check that all required parameters are present and that they are of the correct type. If a parameter is of the wrong type, it should throw a `ClassCastException`.
    

Ensure that your classes and methods are well-documented and follow good coding practices. Include unit tests to verify the functionality of your code.

**Constraints:**

- All error messages should be meaningful and user-friendly.
- The `runSimulation` method should catch and handle all types of errors, not just those thrown by the `validateParameters` method.
- The `validateParameters` method should check that all required parameters are present and that they are of the correct type.
- The `logError` method should log all relevant information about the error, including the error message, the stack trace, and the parameters that were passed to the `runSimulation` method when the error occurred.
- The `notifyUser` method should display a user-friendly error message and provide suggestions for how to resolve the error, if possible.
- The `runSimulation` and `validateParameters` methods should be able to handle parameters of different types, thanks to the use of generics in the Map collection.

**Task 3: Generics in Streams**

In this task, you will incorporate the concept of Generics in Streams. You will extend the `ScientificSimulation` class to include a method that processes a stream of simulation parameters. This method will use generics to handle parameters of different types.

**Stream Processing Method**: Create a method named `processParameterStream` in the `ScientificSimulation` class. This method should take a Stream of parameters as an argument and process them. If any errors occur during the processing, it should catch them and use the `SimulationError` class to handle them.

- `processParameterStream(parameters: Stream<Map.Entry<String, Object>>)`: This method should take a Stream of Map entries as an argument, where each entry represents a parameter. It should process each parameter in the stream and apply it to the simulation. If a parameter is of the wrong type, it should throw a `ClassCastException`. If any other errors occur during the processing, it should catch them and use the `SimulationError` class to handle them.

Remember to update your unit tests to verify the functionality of the new method. Also, ensure that your classes and methods are well-documented and follow good coding practices.

**Constraints:**

- The `processParameterStream` method should catch and handle all types of errors, not just `ClassCastException`.
- The `processParameterStream` method should be able to handle parameters of different types, thanks to the use of generics in the Stream.
- The `processParameterStream` method should process each parameter in the stream and apply it to the simulation.
- The `SimulationError` class should be used to handle any errors that occur during the processing of the parameter stream.
- All error messages should be meaningful and user-friendly.
