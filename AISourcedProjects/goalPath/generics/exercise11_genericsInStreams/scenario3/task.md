**Problem: User Behavior Analysis Using Generics and Java Streams**

You are developing a data processing application for a website. The application analyzes user behavior based on different criteria such as time, location, and device. The data is collected in real-time and stored in a list of `UserInteraction` objects. Each `UserInteraction` object has the following fields:

- `userId`: a unique identifier for the user.
- `timestamp`: the time of the interaction in Unix timestamp format.
- `location`: the location of the user at the time of interaction.
- `device`: the device used for the interaction.

Your task is to implement the following functionalities using generics and Java streams:

1. **Filtering Interactions**: Implement a method `filterInteractions` in a class `UserBehaviorAnalyzer`. This method should take a list of `UserInteraction` objects and a `Predicate<UserInteraction>` object as input. It should return a list of `UserInteraction` objects that satisfy the predicate.
    
2. **Grouping Interactions**: Implement a method `groupInteractionsBy` in the same class. This method should take a list of `UserInteraction` objects and a `Function<UserInteraction, K>` object as input, where `K` is the type of the key by which the interactions should be grouped. It should return a `Map<K, List<UserInteraction>>` where each key is a unique value returned by the function and the associated value is a list of `UserInteraction` objects for which the function returned the key.
    
3. **Strategy Design Pattern**: Implement the Strategy Design Pattern to allow the `UserBehaviorAnalyzer` class to switch between different filtering and grouping strategies at runtime. Create an interface `UserInteractionStrategy` with two methods: `filter` and `group`. Implement this interface in two classes: `LocationStrategy` and `DeviceStrategy`. The `LocationStrategy` should filter interactions based on location and group them by user, while the `DeviceStrategy` should filter interactions based on device and group them by location.

New Task: **Performance Optimization for User Behavior Analysis**

Building on the previous tasks, your next task is to optimize the performance of the `UserBehaviorAnalyzer` class. This will ensure that the application can handle large volumes of data in real-time.

1. **Parallel Processing**: Modify the `filterInteractions` and `groupInteractionsBy` methods to use parallel streams. This will allow the application to process multiple interactions simultaneously, which can significantly improve performance on multi-core systems.
    
2. **Efficient Grouping**: In the `groupInteractionsBy` method, use the `groupingByConcurrent` collector instead of `groupingBy`. This will create a concurrent map, which can be populated by multiple threads simultaneously.
    
3. **Benchmarking**: Implement a method `benchmark` in the `UserBehaviorAnalyzer` class. This method should take a list of `UserInteraction` objects as input, perform the filtering and grouping operations, and return the time taken in milliseconds. Use the `System.nanoTime` method to measure the time.

**Constraints:**

- All string inputs are alphanumeric and have length ≤ 100.
- The `timestamp` is a positive long value.
- The `location` and `device` fields are not null.
- The list of `UserInteraction` objects will not exceed 10^5 in size.

**Example:**

Suppose we have a list of `UserInteraction` objects as follows:
List<UserInteraction> interactions = Arrays.asList(
    new UserInteraction("user1", 1622524800L, "New York", "Mobile"),
    new UserInteraction("user2", 1622524900L, "Los Angeles", "Desktop"),
    new UserInteraction("user1", 1622525000L, "New York", "Mobile"),
    new UserInteraction("user3", 1622525100L, "New York", "Tablet")
);

- The `filterInteractions` method can be used to filter interactions that occurred in "New York" as follows:
List<UserInteraction> nyInteractions = analyzer.filterInteractions(interactions, interaction -> interaction.getLocation().equals("New York"));

- The `groupInteractionsBy` method can be used to group interactions by device as follows:
Map<String, List<UserInteraction>> interactionsByDevice = analyzer.groupInteractionsBy(interactions, UserInteraction::getDevice);

- The `UserBehaviorAnalyzer` can switch between the `LocationStrategy` and `DeviceStrategy` at runtime as follows: 
analyzer.setStrategy(new LocationStrategy()); 
analyzer.analyze(interactions); 
analyzer.setStrategy(new DeviceStrategy()); 
analyzer.analyze(interactions);

// Create a UserBehaviorAnalyzer
UserBehaviorAnalyzer analyzer = new UserBehaviorAnalyzer();

// Benchmark the performance
long timeTaken = analyzer.benchmark(interactions);
System.out.println("Time taken: " + timeTaken + " ms");

**Note:**

- In the `filterInteractions` method, you should use the `stream` and `filter` methods of the `List` interface.
- In the `groupInteractionsBy` method, you should use the `stream` and `collect` methods of the `List` interface, and the `groupingBy` collector of the `Collectors` class.
- In the `UserBehaviorAnalyzer` class, you should use the Strategy Design Pattern to allow switching between different strategies at runtime.
- In the `benchmark` method, you should use the `System.nanoTime` method to measure the time.
- This task requires you to integrate the use of generics, streams, the Strategy Design Pattern, and performance optimization techniques.
