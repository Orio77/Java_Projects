**Refined Scenario 1:** You are developing a scientific simulation tool that uses generics extensively. Create comprehensive unit tests to validate the correctness of generic components and ensure accurate simulation results, ensuring type safety and correctness.

**Sprint Tasks:**

1. **Design Unit Tests that Cover Various Scenarios and Edge Cases Involving Generic Classes and Methods:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - Define a `testGenericSimulation` method that accepts a `Simulation<T>` object and a `T` expected result, and asserts that the simulation produces the expected result.
    - **Description:**
        - The `testGenericSimulation` method demonstrates how unit tests can be designed to cover various scenarios and edge cases involving generic classes and methods, ensuring type safety and correctness.
2. **Implement Test Cases to Verify that Generic Simulations Produce Expected Outcomes:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - Implement test cases for the `testGenericSimulation` method with different types of simulations and expected results.
    - **Description:**
        - Implementing test cases for the `testGenericSimulation` method verifies that generic simulations produce expected outcomes, ensuring the correctness of the simulation tool.
3. **Continuously Update and Expand the Test Suite as New Generic Components are Added:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - Implement a `addTest` method that accepts a `Test<T>` object and adds it to the test suite.
    - **Description:**
        - The `addTest` method demonstrates how the test suite can be continuously updated and expanded as new generic components are added, ensuring that the test suite remains comprehensive and up-to-date.
