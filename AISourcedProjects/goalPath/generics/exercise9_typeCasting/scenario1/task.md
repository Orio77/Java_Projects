**Refined Scenario:** Scenario 1: Develop a financial application using Java, implementing type casting and type checking to ensure that user-provided values are compatible with the expected data types for interest rate calculations.

1. **Develop Methods for Casting User Input:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - `castToDouble`: A method that attempts to cast user input to a double.
    - **Description:**
        - The `castToDouble` method demonstrates how to cast user input to the appropriate numeric data type for interest rate calculations.
        - This method attempts to cast the user input to a double, which is typically used for interest rate calculations due to its precision.
2. **Implement Type Checks:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - `isValidType`: A method that checks if the user input is of the expected data type.
    - **Description:**
        - The `isValidType` method demonstrates how to implement type checks to validate user input against expected data types.
        - This method checks if the user input can be cast to a double, ensuring that the input is compatible with the expected data type for interest rate calculations.
3. **Handle Exceptions and Provide User-Friendly Error Messages:**
    
    - **Methods to Implement:**
        - `handleTypeMismatch`: A method that handles type mismatch exceptions and provides user-friendly error messages.
    - **Description:**
        - The `handleTypeMismatch` method demonstrates how to handle exceptions and provide user-friendly error messages for type mismatches.
        - This method catches any exceptions that occur during type casting or checking, and provides a user-friendly error message to inform the user of the issue.
