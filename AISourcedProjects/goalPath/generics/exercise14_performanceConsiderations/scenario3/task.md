**Topic: Performance Considerations with Generics and Understanding Generics in Collections**

**Problem: Optimizing Game Engine with Generics and Managing Game Objects with Collections**

Building upon the game engine you've been working on, you are now tasked with managing the game objects using collections. The game engine still has two main components: the `Renderer` and the `PhysicsEngine`. Both of these components make extensive use of generics to handle different types of game objects (like `Player`, `Enemy`, `Obstacle`, etc.). Your task is to optimize the use of generics in these components and manage the game objects using collections to ensure smooth gameplay experiences.

**Functionalities:**

1. **Generic Object Pooling:** Continue to use the generic object pool to optimize memory usage. The object pool should be able to handle any type of game object. It should have the following methods:
    
    - `acquire()`: Returns an object from the pool. If the pool is empty, it creates a new object.
    - `release(T object)`: Returns an object to the pool.
2. **Generic Collision Detection:** Continue to use the generic method in the `PhysicsEngine` to detect collisions between different types of game objects. The method should take two game objects as parameters and return a boolean indicating whether a collision has occurred.
    
3. **Manage Game Objects with Collections:** Implement a method in the `Renderer` and `PhysicsEngine` to manage game objects using collections. The collections should be able to handle any type of game object. The methods should include:
    
    - `addGameObject(T gameObject)`: Adds a game object to the collection.
    - `removeGameObject(T gameObject)`: Removes a game object from the collection.
    - `getGameObjects()`: Returns the collection of game objects.

**Classes to be implemented:**

1. **GameObject:** This is the base class for all game objects. It should have properties like `position` and `size`.
2. **Player, Enemy, Obstacle:** These classes inherit from `GameObject`. They can have additional properties like `health` for `Player` and `Enemy`, and `damage` for `Obstacle`.
3. **ObjectPool:** This is a generic class for object pooling. It should have a method to acquire an object and a method to release an object back to the pool.
4. **Renderer:** This class is responsible for rendering game objects. It should have methods to manage game objects using collections and a method `render(T gameObject)` that takes a game object and renders it.
5. **PhysicsEngine:** This class is responsible for physics calculations. It should have methods to manage game objects using collections and a method `detectCollision(T1 gameObject1, T2 gameObject2)` that takes two game objects and checks if they have collided.

**Constraints:**

- All game objects are represented in a 3D space.
- The `position` of a game object is represented as a 3D vector with `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates.
- The `size` of a game object is represented as a 3D vector with `width`, `height`, and `depth`.
- The `health` of a `Player` or `Enemy` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- The `damage` of an `Obstacle` is an integer between 1 and 50.
- The object pool should have a maximum size. If the pool is full, it should not accept any more objects.
- The collision detection method should consider the `position` and `size` of the game objects.
- The collections of game objects should be able to handle any type of game object and should be optimized for performance.

**Task 3: Implementing Generic Interfaces and Classes**

The concept selected is "Generic Interfaces and Classes". This task will involve creating generic interfaces and classes that will be used by the `Renderer` and `PhysicsEngine` classes. This will allow for a more flexible and reusable code structure.

**Functionalities:**

1. **Generic Game Object Interface:** Create a generic interface `IGameObject<T>` that all game objects (`Player`, `Enemy`, `Obstacle`) will implement. The interface should define common methods that all game objects should have, such as `getPosition()`, `getSize()`, and `update()`. The `update()` method will be responsible for updating the state of the game object.
    
2. **Generic Game Object Class:** Create a generic class `GameObject<T>` that implements the `IGameObject<T>` interface. This class will provide a basic implementation of the interface methods. The `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Obstacle` classes will extend this class and provide their own specific implementations if necessary.
    
3. **Generic Game Object Collection:** Create a generic class `GameObjectCollection<T extends IGameObject>` that will be used by the `Renderer` and `PhysicsEngine` classes to manage game objects. This class should implement the `Iterable<T>` interface and provide methods for adding, removing, and retrieving game objects.
    
4. **Update Renderer and PhysicsEngine:** Update the `Renderer` and `PhysicsEngine` classes to use the `GameObjectCollection` class for managing game objects. Also, update the `render(T gameObject)` method in the `Renderer` class and the `detectCollision(T1 gameObject1, T2 gameObject2)` method in the `PhysicsEngine` class to accept objects that implement the `IGameObject` interface.
    

**Constraints:**

- The `IGameObject` interface and `GameObject` class should be generic and able to handle any type of game object.
- The `GameObjectCollection` class should be optimized for performance and able to handle any type of game object that implements the `IGameObject` interface.
- The `Renderer` and `PhysicsEngine` classes should be updated to use the new generic interfaces and classes.
- The `update()` method in the `IGameObject` interface should be responsible for updating the state of the game object. The specific implementation of this method will depend on the type of game object.
- The `GameObjectCollection` class should implement the `Iterable<T>` interface, which will allow for the game objects to be iterated over in a for-each loop.
