Topic: Generics Best Practises

Scenario 1: You are involved in a project to build a web application framework. Ensure that the framework follows best practices related to generics, such as using the diamond operator to simplify code and enhance type inference.
    
    Sprint Tasks:
    
    - Review existing code and refactor to use the diamond operator where applicable.
    - Educate the development team on the importance of following generics best practices.
    - Implement code reviews to maintain adherence to these best practices.
