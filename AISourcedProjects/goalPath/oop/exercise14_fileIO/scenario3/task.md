1. **Task Refinement**: Design a class 'FileHandler' to encapsulate File I/O operations.
    
    - **Classes to Create**:
        - Class: `FileHandler`
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - In `FileHandler`: No specific methods are mentioned in this task, but you might consider methods like `readFile()`, `writeFile()`.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `readFile()`: This method should handle the logic for reading data from a file.
        - `writeFile()`: This method should handle the logic for writing data to a file.
2. **Task Refinement**: Implement a method 'readMetadata' in the 'FileHandler' class to read file metadata.
    
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - Implement a method `readMetadata()` in the `FileHandler` class that reads the metadata of a file.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `readMetadata()`: This method should take a file path as input and return the metadata of the file. The metadata might include details like file size, creation date, modification date, etc.
3. **Task Refinement**: Implement methods 'renameFile' and 'deleteFile' in the 'FileHandler' class to rename and delete a file.
    
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - Implement methods `renameFile()` and `deleteFile()` in the `FileHandler` class that rename and delete a file, respectively.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `renameFile()`: This method should take a file path and a new name as input and rename the file.
        - `deleteFile()`: This method should take a file path as input and delete the file.
