1. **Task Refinement**: Design a class to represent the library and use the static keyword to represent the collection of books.
    
    - **Classes to Create**:
        - Class: `Library`
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - In `Library`: No specific methods are mentioned in this task, but you might consider methods like `addBook()`, `removeBook()`.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `addBook()`: This static method should allow adding a book to the static collection of books in the library.
        - `removeBook()`: This static method should allow removing a book from the static collection of books in the library.
2. **Task Refinement**: Implement the book lending service and use static methods to interact with the static collection of books.
    
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - Implement a static method `lendBook()` in the `Library` class that interacts with the static collection of books.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `lendBook()`: This static method should allow lending a book to a user. It should interact with the static collection of books, checking if the requested book is available and, if so, removing it from the collection.
3. **Task Refinement**: Use the final keyword to represent the rules of the library that do not change.
    
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - Implement a method `canBorrow()` in the `Library` class that checks if a user has reached the maximum limit before lending a book.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `canBorrow()`: This method should check if a user has reached the maximum limit of borrowed books (represented by a final variable) before lending a book. If the user has not reached the limit, the method should return true; otherwise, it should return false.
