1. **Task Refinement**: Design an abstract class for media content and derive specific media classes from it, also design interfaces for behaviors that are not common to all media types.
    
    - **Classes to Create**:
        - Abstract class: `Media`
        - Derived classes: `Song`, `Podcast`
        - Interfaces: `IPlayable`, `IDownloadable`
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - In `Media`: `play()`, `download()`
            - `play()`: This method should handle the logic for playing the media content.
            - `download()`: This method should handle the logic for downloading the media content.
        - In `Song` and `Podcast`: Override `play()`, `download()`
            - `play()`: This method should handle the specific logic for playing a song or podcast.
            - `download()`: This method should handle the specific logic for downloading a song or podcast.
        - In `IPlayable` and `IDownloadable`: Define `play()`, `download()`
            - `play()`: This method should provide a contract for playing media content.
            - `download()`: This method should provide a contract for downloading media content.
2. **Task Refinement**: Design an abstract class for users and derive specific user classes from it, also design interfaces for behaviors that are not common to all user types.
    
    - **Classes to Create**:
        - Abstract class: `User`
        - Derived classes: `Listener`, `Creator`
        - Interfaces: `IListener`, `ICreator`
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - In `User`: `login()`, `logout()`
            - `login()`: This method should handle the logic for user login.
            - `logout()`: This method should handle the logic for user logout.
        - In `Listener` and `Creator`: Override `login()`, `logout()`
            - `login()`: This method should handle the specific logic for listener or creator login.
            - `logout()`: This method should handle the specific logic for listener or creator logout.
        - In `IListener` and `ICreator`: Define `listen()`, `create()`
            - `listen()`: This method should provide a contract for listening to media content.
            - `create()`: This method should provide a contract for creating media content.
3. **Task Refinement**: Implement polymorphism to handle behaviors of media content and users.
    
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - Use the methods in the `Media` and `User` classes to implement behaviors.
            - The methods should be used to handle different behaviors through a unified interface.
        - Use polymorphism to handle different behaviors through a unified interface.
            - Polymorphism should be used to allow objects of different types to be treated as objects of a superclass type.
