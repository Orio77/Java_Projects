**Enhanced Scenario 1: Developing a User-friendly Mobile App with Core Java Design Principles**

- Enhanced Task 1: Create a `Navigation` class that applies principles of user interface design for intuitive navigation.
    
    - Potential Input: A `Navigation` class with basic methods like `navigateToHome()`, `navigateToSettings()`, etc.
    - Desired Output: A `Navigation` class where methods have been improved using design principles such as encapsulation and inheritance. For example, a `BaseNavigation` class could be created with common methods, and `HomeNavigation` and `SettingsNavigation` classes could extend this base class.
    - Coach Suggestions: Start by identifying areas where encapsulation can be used to hide complex navigation logic. Consider creating a base class for common navigation features and extending it for specific use cases.
- Enhanced Task 2: Create a `VisualElements` interface to ensure consistency in visual elements and interactions throughout the app.
    
    - Potential Input: A `VisualElements` interface with methods like `display()`, `interact()`, etc.
    - Desired Output: A `VisualElements` interface where methods are consistent, achieved through the use of design principles like polymorphism and interfaces. Classes like `Button` and `Slider` should implement this interface.
    - Coach Suggestions: Identify common visual elements and interactions and abstract them into interfaces. Implement these interfaces in the classes representing the visual elements. Use polymorphism to handle these elements in a consistent way.
- Enhanced Task 3: Create a `FeedbackSystem` class to incorporate user feedback and usability testing for continuous improvement.
    
    - Potential Input: A `FeedbackSystem` class with basic methods like `collectFeedback()`, `runUsabilityTest()`, etc.
    - Desired Output: A `FeedbackSystem` class where user feedback is incorporated and usability testing is possible, achieved through the use of design principles like the observer pattern. The `FeedbackSystem` class should observe changes in the app and provide feedback.
    - Coach Suggestions: Implement the observer pattern to allow the app to react to user feedback. Consider creating a separate class for handling usability tests, which can observe changes in the app and provide feedback.
