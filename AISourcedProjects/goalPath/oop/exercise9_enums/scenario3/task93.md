1. **Task Refinement**: Design a class to represent the vending machine and an enum to represent the states of the vending machine.
    
    - **Classes and Enums to Create**:
        - Class: `VendingMachine`
        - Enum: `State` with values `IDLE`, `SELECTING`, `PAYING`, `DISPENSING`
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - In `VendingMachine`: No specific methods are mentioned in this task, but you might consider methods like `selectItem()`, `insertPayment()`, and `dispenseItem()`.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `selectItem()`: This method should allow the user to select an item from the vending machine. It should change the state of the machine to `SELECTING`.
        - `insertPayment()`: This method should allow the user to insert payment for the selected item. It should change the state of the machine to `PAYING`.
        - `dispenseItem()`: This method should dispense the selected item once payment is received. It should change the state of the machine to `DISPENSING`.
2. **Task Refinement**: Use the enum to represent the current state of the vending machine.
    
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - Add a property to the `VendingMachine` class of type `State` to represent the current state.
        - Implement methods to change the state of the vending machine based on user actions.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - The methods should change the state of the vending machine based on user actions. For example, selecting an item should change the state to `SELECTING`, inserting payment should change the state to `PAYING`, and dispensing an item should change the state to `DISPENSING`.
3. **Task Refinement**: Implement methods in the vending machine class to handle user actions based on the current state.
    
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - Implement methods `selectItem()`, `insertPayment()`, `dispenseItem()` in the `VendingMachine` class that change the state of the vending machine and perform actions based on the current state.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `selectItem()`: This method should allow the user to select an item from the vending machine. It should change the state of the machine to `SELECTING` and perform any actions associated with this state.
        - `insertPayment()`: This method should allow the user to insert payment for the selected item. It should change the state of the machine to `PAYING` and perform any actions associated with this state.
        - `dispenseItem()`: This method should dispense the selected item once payment is received. It should change the state of the machine to `DISPENSING` and perform any actions associated with this state.
