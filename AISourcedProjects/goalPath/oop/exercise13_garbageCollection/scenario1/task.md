**Scenario 1**: "Building a Real-time Data Analytics Platform"

- **Task 1**: Develop data processing modules that generate temporary data objects.
    
    - **Enhanced Task**: Develop a `DataProcessor` class with a `processData(Stream<Data> dataStream)` method. This method should create temporary `ProcessedData` objects that hold intermediate results. Once the processing of a `Data` object is complete, ensure that the `ProcessedData` object is no longer referenced, making it eligible for garbage collection.
    - _Potential input_: `dataProcessor.processData(dataStream)`
    - _Desired Output_: A `Stream<ProcessedData>` with all temporary `ProcessedData` objects used during processing being eligible for garbage collection.
    - _Coach Suggestions_: Use local variables for the `ProcessedData` objects and ensure they are not referenced outside the scope of the method. This will make them eligible for garbage collection once the method execution is complete.
- **Task 2**: Monitor memory usage and implement strategies to minimize unnecessary objects.
    
    - **Enhanced Task**: Use a Java profiler to monitor the memory usage of your application while the `processData` method is running. Identify any unnecessary objects that are being created and optimize your code to minimize these. Implement a strategy such as object pooling for reusable objects to avoid creating new objects unnecessarily.
    - _Potential input_: `dataProcessor.processData(dataStream)`
    - _Desired Output_: Reduced memory usage as shown in the Java profiler.
    - _Coach Suggestions_: Use a Java profiler like VisualVM or JProfiler to monitor memory usage. Look for spikes in memory usage that correspond to the creation of unnecessary objects and optimize your code to avoid these.
- **Task 3**: Ensure efficient garbage collection to maintain system performance.
    
    - **Enhanced Task**: Review your code to ensure that objects are made eligible for garbage collection as soon as they are no longer needed. Avoid creating a large number of short-lived objects, as these can cause frequent garbage collections and impact system performance. Implement a strategy such as object pooling or the flyweight pattern for reusable objects.
    - _Potential input_: `dataProcessor.processData(dataStream)`
    - _Desired Output_: Smooth system performance with no noticeable delays due to garbage collection, as observed in the Java profiler.
    - _Coach Suggestions_: Review your code to identify any places where you are creating unnecessary short-lived objects. Consider using design patterns like object pooling or the flyweight pattern to reuse objects instead of creating new ones.
