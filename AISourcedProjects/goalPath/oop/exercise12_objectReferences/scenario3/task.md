1. **Task Refinement**: Design an abstract class for users and derive specific user classes from it.
    
    - **Classes to Create**:
        - Abstract class: `User`
        - Derived classes: `Customer`, `Staff`, `Manager`
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - In `User`: No specific methods are mentioned in this task, but you might consider methods like `login()`, `logout()`.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `login()`: This method should handle the logic for user login.
        - `logout()`: This method should handle the logic for user logout.
2. **Task Refinement**: Design an abstract class for orders and derive specific order classes from it.
    
    - **Classes to Create**:
        - Abstract class: `Order`
        - Derived classes: `DineInOrder`, `TakeOutOrder`, `DeliveryOrder`
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - In `Order`: No specific methods are mentioned in this task, but you might consider methods like `placeOrder()`, `cancelOrder()`.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - `placeOrder()`: This method should handle the logic for placing an order.
        - `cancelOrder()`: This method should handle the logic for canceling an order.
3. **Task Refinement**: Implement polymorphism to handle behaviors of users and orders.
    
    - **Methods to Implement**:
        - Use the methods in the `User` and `Order` classes to implement behaviors.
        - Use polymorphism to handle different behaviors through a unified interface.
    - **Method Descriptions**:
        - The methods should be used to handle different behaviors through a unified interface.
        - Polymorphism should be used to allow objects of different types to be treated as objects of a superclass type.
