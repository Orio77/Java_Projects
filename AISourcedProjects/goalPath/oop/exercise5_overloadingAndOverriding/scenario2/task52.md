Scenario 2: Developing a Music Player with Equalizer
Enhanced Sprint Tasks:

Task 1: Define an AudioPlayer class with overloaded methods for audio playback.
Enhanced Task 1 part: Implement method overloading in the AudioPlayer class. Provide multiple play methods with different parameters (e.g., one method plays the audio at the default volume, another takes the volume as a parameter, and another takes the volume and equalizer settings as parameters).
Enhanced Task 1 part: Implement a play method that takes an AudioFile object as a parameter. This method should play the audio file with its associated settings.
Enhanced Task 1 part: Implement a play method that takes a Playlist object as a parameter. This method should play all the audio files in the playlist in order.
~~
Task 2: Implement specialized playback options like equalizer settings.
Enhanced Task 2 part: Implement a setEqualizerSettings method in the AudioPlayer class. This method should take equalizer settings as parameters and apply them to the audio playback.
Enhanced Task 2 part: Implement a getEqualizerSettings method in the AudioPlayer class. This method should return the current equalizer settings.
Enhanced Task 2 part: Implement a resetEqualizerSettings method in the AudioPlayer class. This method should reset the equalizer settings to their default values.
~~
Task 3: Ensure that users can customize audio playback based on their preferences.
Enhanced Task 3 part: Implement a CustomAudioPlayer class that inherits from AudioPlayer. This class should override the play methods to allow users to customize audio playback based on their preferences.
Enhanced Task 3 part: Implement a setPreferences method in the CustomAudioPlayer class. This method should take user preferences as parameters and apply them to the audio playback.
Enhanced Task 3 part: Implement a getPreferences method in the CustomAudioPlayer class. This method should return the current user preferences.
