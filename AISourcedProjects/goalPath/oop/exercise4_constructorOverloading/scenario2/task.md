# Scenario 2: Building a Restaurant Menu

## Enhanced Sprint Tasks:

### Task 1: Define a MenuItem class with constructors for dishes, including name and price.

- Implement constructor overloading in the MenuItem class. Provide multiple constructors with different parameters (e.g., one constructor only takes name and price, another takes name, price, and ingredients, and another takes name, price, ingredients, and description).
- Implement a constructor that takes a MenuItem object as a parameter. This constructor should create a new MenuItem with the same properties as the given object (copy constructor).
- Implement a default constructor that creates a MenuItem with default values.

### Task 2: Develop functions to create menu items with varying ingredients and descriptions.

- Use the overloaded constructors from Task 1 to create menu items with varying ingredients and descriptions.
- Implement a function that takes a MenuItem object and a new ingredient, and returns a new MenuItem object with the added ingredient.
- Implement a function that takes a MenuItem object and a new description, and returns a new MenuItem object with the updated description.

### Task 3: Populate a restaurant menu with a variety of dishes.

- Use the overloaded constructors and functions from Tasks 1 and 2 to populate the restaurant menu with a variety of dishes.
- Implement a function that takes a MenuItem object and adds it to the restaurant menu.
- Implement a function that takes a MenuItem object and removes it from the restaurant menu.
